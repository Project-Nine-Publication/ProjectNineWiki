            <p>(Design) We are completely NOT using the original meaning/inetity of the word &quot;荨麻&quot; (as in chinese), and this thing is exactly the legendary version of Mrijunna with similar effects except that in this fictional universe, it can connect one to god - or it can kill.</p>
<h2 id="pronounciation">Pronounciation</h2>

<h2 id="names">Names</h2>
<p>Due to the prolonged history and legends of this plant, there are many different names for it across different cultures/continents/countries/languages and different historical time periods. Below is a summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ancient kanit text: 毛䕭, 䕭草, 䕭麻, 荨草，麻草，荨麻草, 燖</li>
<li>Modern day kanit: 大荨, 知母</li>
<li>Tellurian Alphabetica: Merveil，母耶，魔耶，摩耶，摩耶草</li>
<li>Modern: 魔凫，魔孚</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<p>Also see [[Renascence]]: You specifically need to: hold the memory till death. When you die, you momentarily wakes up in the &quot;hotel room&quot;. Then you could (through practice?) remain sober a bit before dive in again - and ask your brother for changes this time. Any kind of changes indeed. Because if changes were not made the first time (during birth) (on the structural level), it's not possible during life. That's also the secret of Fepulans. Most life beings if never realized this, will just continue their miserable life to the next cycle.</p>
<p>When in &quot;koma&quot; (pending word), those who believed they are dead will just die and continue their cycles. Those who question things or are more critical or desire life or fear death can come back.</p>
<p>(idea from) 20250108 (unrecorded) dream: dreamt of alien spaceship crashing and hitting a building at campus and we saw alien came out with some friends then memory wiped and behavior reset but didn't question I was in dream.</p>

<h3 id="a.1-why-isnt-tobacco-used-as-tea-leave-and-why-arent-traditional-tea-smoked">A.1 Why isn't tobacco used as tea leave and why aren't traditional tea smoked?</h3>
<pre><code>Great question! Let's break this down from both biological and cultural perspectives.

1. Why isn't tobacco used as tea?
Chemical Composition: Tobacco contains nicotine, a potent stimulant and neurotoxin. Even in small doses, ingesting nicotine directly can cause severe poisoning, with symptoms like nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and even seizures in extreme cases. Drinking it as tea would expose the body to dangerous levels of nicotine absorption through the digestive system.

Addiction and Health Risks: Nicotine is highly addictive. If consumed as tea, it could increase the risk of dependency just as smoking or chewing tobacco does. Furthermore, tobacco contains other harmful substances, including carcinogens like nitrosamines, which make it hazardous for consumption by any means.

Preparation Methods: Tea leaves are carefully processed to preserve flavors, aromas, and antioxidants. Tobacco undergoes a curing process that's different and often involves additives, making it unsuitable for brewing.

Regulation: Many countries heavily regulate tobacco use. Introducing it as a drinkable tea would complicate existing public health efforts and likely face strict restrictions.

2. Why aren't traditional teas smoked?
Tea Composition: Traditional tea leaves (like green, black, or oolong) contain caffeine, tannins, and polyphenols, which are designed to dissolve in water to release flavor and antioxidants. These compounds are not as effective when burned and inhaled, as heat would break them down before they provide any benefit. The enjoyment of tea comes from steeping, not combustion.

Different Purpose: Tea is prized for its calming effects and complex flavors, which are better appreciated through drinking. Smoking it wouldn't provide the same relaxing ritual or nuanced taste. On the contrary, burning tea could introduce unpleasant flavors and toxic chemicals from combustion, making it a poor substitute for smoking tobacco or other herbs.

Cultural Practice: Historically, tea-drinking cultures (like those in China, Japan, and India) valued tea for both medicinal and spiritual reasons, with an emphasis on brewing as a method of preparation. Smoking was never associated with the same therapeutic benefits that steeping offered.

Health Concerns: Even though tea leaves contain beneficial compounds, burning them could release carcinogens or harmful byproducts (like tar) similar to other plant matter. This would defeat the health advantages of drinking tea.

Summary
Tobacco isn't used as tea because it contains dangerous chemicals like nicotine that are harmful when ingested. On the other hand, tea isn't smoked because its beneficial compounds are best released in water, and burning it would destroy them, making the experience both unhealthy and unappealing.
