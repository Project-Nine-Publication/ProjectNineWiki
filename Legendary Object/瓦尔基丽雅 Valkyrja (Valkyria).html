        <p>(THIS IS A LEGEND FOR SURE, BUT IT'S NOT A TRUE &quot;LEGENDARY OBJECT&quot; IN THE SENSE OF 神器; It's just a techno wonder)</p>
<p>(来源待议，历史待议，存在意义待议)</p>
<p>Historically possess by Kun, the last instance was protected and owned by Mr. Leng (who asked 白斩 for its usage and kind of took it from 白斩, who was authorized by Kun VII; When Kun VI came, she took it back). It's an object that mostly serves symbolic value for it's not particular practical in any aspect. It's symbolized as one of Kun's most precious possessings（珺之至宝），以圣剑形式存在。It's honestly nothing special except it's a marvel (like pyramids) and serves mostly symbolic and for fun (like a jewled crown/tiara). For it's too costly to be constructed and not superbly practical. So it's built once, and kept as is. To become an owner, the previous owner just need to transfer the ownership (teaching the way of using it) in a ritual.</p>
<p>It's built by Kun III for fun - for it's relatively easy to build it for anyone possessing the power of Hyupeda. Kun VII doesn't even care that much about it and when she left, she gave it to 白斩 as a means to comfort Mr. Leng that she/Kun VI will come back. Delinm doesn't want to give Mr. Leng directly because Mr. Leng is too ambitious and might take it as a symbol of power.</p>
<p>There are two uses: 1) It's superbly thing and sharp and can literally cut through ANYTHING; 2) When using a special technique and used by the owner of the sword and when slashing against a human form in &quot;activated mode&quot;, the sword becomes &quot;windy&quot; or virtualized and cut through the body without causing any damage. In this case it's not a weapon that kills - slashing the sword on a person will allow it to tempoarily separate its spirit from its body (to Medalians this is permanent, to Tellurians, this is not permanent). The effect on Tellurian is a side-effect - not part of the original intentional design.</p>
<p>Original concepts/ideas：</p>
<ul>
<li>“夜权”：从周边环境中汲取光的能量、夜幕降临、风云变化、唯它睥睨</li>
<li>这不是一把本身可以呼天唤地的武器，而是洗礼、传承王的意志时用的工具</li>
<li>这是一把人类造物、科技传奇而不是玄幻传奇：参见20190322梦——要么是纯粹人工生产要么是半培育生物方式生产，这把白骨剑（平制而不是脊椎骨）无坚不摧，锋利到即便是珺也不会去当面硬接。如果决定还是使用玄幻的剑作为瓦尔基里雅的话（毕竟白骨的跟这个名字很不恰当）那么这把白骨的剑（待更严谨的命名）可以给白斩</li>
</ul>
