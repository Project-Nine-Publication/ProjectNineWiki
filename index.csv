"(Citadel of) Capital Investments (CCI)","Citadel of Capital Investments (CCI)","Organization","Originally founded by Mr. Leng and Tao Ye, Citadel of Capital Investments is a key establishing pillar of many aspects of NFC and a large popular project funds based on NFC. It's the means of establishing large civic influence without going through the political path. Many of the otherwise large-scale ""arbitrary"" projects are funded directly or indirectly by CCI, including CofN Open Platform, and The Many Worlds gaming network. Surprisingly, as an ""investment firm"", CCI is not profit driven when it comes to private investments - a large portion of its allocable funds for private investments are channeled directly from capitals of very rich investors (kind of like angel investment) rather than rely on existing fund returns. In terms of trading, the biggest advantage of CCI is its quantitative strategies and arbitrage capacities, including the initial proprietary algorithms developed by Tao Ye before Mr. Leng funded NFC. CCI provides the initial funding and support for those long-term large-scale wholistic projects in the hope that over the long term the financial benefits are considerable - or even if not, the money is owned by various interested investors and the loss is assumed. Many of the prominent investors are associated with TLO and they are super rich. Notably, even not always with support from other stakeholders, just Tao Ye and Mr. Leng is capable of injecting funds directly because they are the main stakeholders. The company (as of ""present day"") currently employees around 3500 employees and manages funds and investment projects internationally. One key feature of CCI is it tries best to manage lots of stuff internally in order to minimize operational cost and reduce communication overhead and impose fine-grained control. Among other assets, CCI directly owns The Flying Castle, which is leased to NFC military.","Organization",https://project-nine-publication.github.io/ProjectNineWiki/Organization/%28Citadel%20of%29%20Capital%20Investments%20%28CCI%29.html,English

"Interstellar Human (Tellurian) Trafficking","Interstellar Human (Tellurian) Trafficking","Concept","(Plot, theme, style, 魔幻现实, #Novel, #Content, Management) Medalian people buy, sell, capture, and showcase enslaved humans - this is unavoidable since the security on earth and technology on earth is so low and easily penetratable, anyone with that capacity will immediately seize the market and make a profit - there will definitely be at least a few dozen people having this need, idea and desire to visit humans, and when such needs cannot be easily satisfied by joining the expedition team, they will seek a ""twisted"" version of the realization, thus folstering the inter-galactic slave business. Such enslaving is manefested in many many aspects, from simple pet stores in the Undercity to captures and transportation (human trafficking) to prostitution to child marriage to much more elaborate trained individual human servants with high status. The trade involves all countries, all levels of government, politics and bribery. Other more interesting manifesctations include paintings - from basic illustration as record of individuals, to illustrations of activities performed by enslaved people, to more expensive Exotic Oil painted masterfully crafted piece of arts of those people, sold back to the original planet (also it's worth mentioning despite the high level of space technology, the diverse culture and long historical heritage of Medala necessarily implies that the development will NOT be universal or equal - e.g. some parts of Kai will be much more highly developed than other parts, and the more rural parts of the source planets might even be considered ""rural""). The key here for the purpose of the novel is to make it bizarre - and think back and in reference to the slave trade, and those events described in the two novels: 百年孤独 and Candide.","Concept",https://project-nine-publication.github.io/ProjectNineWiki/Concept/Interstellar%20Human%20%28Tellurian%29%20Trafficking.html,English

"车臣牌","车臣牌","CardGame","例如粉色阵营（另有Lore名称）有很多可爱的角色卡牌。另有黑色阵营，绿色阵营，白色阵营，蓝色阵营，黄色阵营。主角血量消耗完为止，主角血量可以累计，有牌型和技能可以给主角牌增加buff，包括直接数值buff和percentage buff。主角卡绘画十分独特（动漫画风，并不过分精致但是元素丰富）。属于fantasy游戏。角色卡一般上面画角色，下面写一句对话。另有一至两个技能，应该没有自己的血量，应该是一次性使用（就像是扑克牌）实现某种效果。（或许所有的卡牌都是角色卡，因为一次性使用）可能只有右上角写有一个伤害点数（2-6）。“车臣牌”是一种特殊牌，上面写有三个行为。。。初始血量一种生成方式是丢两个骰子随机——第一个是生命力，第二个是魔法力。玩法：初始每人抽7张，回合制，每人每回合选择一个攻击对象出牌较量，当前回合默认抽一张新牌（包括第一回合）。该游戏血量耗尽为出局，卡牌抽完和手牌用完为一回合结束。该游戏胜负并没有很大区别（就像扑克），主要是抽牌、打牌、读牌的乐趣。卡牌行为：有卡牌能力可以允许多抽3张。三或者四大阵营，扑克牌数目（一副或者两幅），每次出牌可以不限制张数（手牌出完为止），该游戏0学习上手。如果一副扑克（54张）不够可以两副，一般一副扑克是两到三个人数目。扑克牌可以直接混用（即如果拆了两副那么可以用完之后按数目拆回）。出厂不同扑克可能带有少量不同的卡牌种类（具有一定的收藏和积累价值）。Lok Han带我们（我和Kong）在公车/火车上玩的。另有卡牌类型和规则细节已经忘记。这个游戏不必concept complete，我们只需要“mention”和侧面描述即可。颇为Popular。特点是她玩的时候会撕小卡片把自己的buff都记下来。","CardGame",https://project-nine-publication.github.io/ProjectNineWiki/CardGame/%E8%BD%A6%E8%87%A3%E7%89%8C.html,English
