        <p>Super Earth (as the technical astronomy term that describes a planet like earth); Home planet for Medala People. I would imagine Ids to be at least <em>1/3 bigger than Earth</em>, just for its magnificance, and <strong>large contients</strong>. <!--At the moment we chose a radius that's double that of Earth/Tellus--></p>
<p>The Medalians are a very advanced but human-like alien species. They have appearances that are just like humans but they also possess certain special qualities that makes them stand out from ordinary human individuals. Such features will allow them to possess and use some &quot;light&quot; magical powers - things like moving faster or being able to react much faster than us humans. On the other extreme, some of those magical features allows certain alien individuals to be able to change their body temperature or hold their breath for prolonged periods of time. However, such special powers are very rare and highly sought after because of great utilities. The racial differentiation of the Medalian species are fostered by their special living habitat - certain Medalian races possess very strong muscles and very efficient circulatory system, which allows them to move much faster than a human.</p>
<p>The planet in general has a higher gravity than earth and a thicker atmosphere. It's an oxygen-poor environment so the Medalians generally have slim but strong bodies (like Avatar 2 water tribe?) - they have developed efficient respiratory system that allows them to hold their breath for extended periods. The general composition of atmosphere is similar to ours, as humans and your alien species share a similar physique. However there are naturally exposed mines that contains strong radiation exposure. The presence of high levels of heavy metals are also abundant on Ids across continents and different race can contain different pigments in their skin depending on the adundance of corresponding minerals in their ecosystem and water.</p>
<p>As for the mystical explanation for the similarity in physique, one possibility is that the aliens share a common ancestor with humans. In that case, both species may have evolved similar physical features under similar environmental pressures. Alternatively, it's possible that advanced extraterrestrial civilizations influenced human evolution in some way, resulting in the similar physical characteristics. However, these are purely speculative ideas and are not based on any tangible evidence.</p>
<p>A super earth, Ids is the home planet for Medala People and the origin of the Medalian species.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ids lacks biological diversity (since it's an artificial planet created by the Creators to host teleported Medalians)</li>
<li>Notice we used to say that Ids has many continents (e.g. Amamu etc.)- then as of 202304 we realized that it's more interesting for Medalians to be more like Mars - there is no continent and maybe only a single ocean. This depicts a barren picture of the Medalian world (and I think it can explain and give some genuine affection for the Medalian affection on Tellus; Krukians don't care - their aesthetics have long beyond the organic shapes)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional (original) design notes (for planet &quot;Kai&quot;):</p>
<ul>
<li>The planet of Kai has two moons (Yei and Na-o) and an ice belt.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="namingetymology">Naming/Etymology</h2>
<ul>
<li>Used to be named &quot;Kai&quot;. (Now we don't use this name, we can assign some local historical significance - e.g. a location on Ids that's named like such; E.g. a historical region covering a large area of north-wester region, like &quot;mesopotamians&quot; or &quot;indo-european&quot;)</li>
<li>Ids, 伊德斯, 依德斯, (伊登斯，意得斯，医登，意渡/艺度，因得，衣德); Ids' people: Idians.</li>
<li>Ids's possessive form: Idan, Idian</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p>Planet-wise speaking, Ids is bigger than Tellus - it's larger by size, and it has more kingdoms, countries and states on it across any historical period. And since its ocean is just slightly so much larger, there are many mysterious places - mystical mountains and magical oceans. It may not have that many continents but there are quite a few large landmass on its ocean.</p>
<p>Ids has both continents speard across the northern part and southern part (because it's larger than Earth?). The Western Hemisphere continents are wide spread apart leaving a gap near equator as ocean. <!--Since Earth has this wider-than-longer Norther hemisphere Eurasia and Tellus had this longer-than-wider Axia, we are thinking giving Ids a wider-than-longer continent as well, but do not cover too much longitudes.--> It has continents on both Northern and Southern Pole, it also has clear and long latitude range of tropical zone, temperate zone and frigid zone.</p>
<h2 id="continents">Continents</h2>
<p>It's an earth-like planet (aka. habitable planet) with <em>8 (major) continents</em> (ordered in alphabetical order):</p>
<!--Notice unlike Pandora in Avatar, it's not a moon or anything-->
<!--Pending adding words roots to those names-->
<ol>
<li><strong>Amamu</strong></li>
<li><strong>Amasia</strong></li>
<li><strong>Amabusa</strong></li>
<li><strong>Amajin</strong> (Majin)</li>
<li><strong>Akan</strong> (Akhan)</li>
<li><strong>Neyu</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reơarto/Riơarto</strong> (Rheoarto) (Freezing Land)</li>
<li><strong>Runkatul</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Among those, <strong>Amabusa</strong> is the largest continent and it's connected to Amamu, Amasia and Akan. Neyu, however, is a very distant continent in the middle of <strong>the Great Ocean</strong> (also known as <strong>&quot;Ikisia&quot;</strong>). Amajin is a long strip of land above the sea with lots of small pieces forming many islands, the majority of this continent is below water. Akan is very cold since it's covering the north pole.</p>
<h2 id="oceans">Oceans</h2>
<p>There are <em>5 major oceans</em> on Ids:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ikima</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ikisia</strong></li>
<li><strong>Nabiusa (Nabyusa)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Kaniki</strong></li>
<li>???</li>
</ul>
<p>Among those, <strong>Ikisia</strong> is called <strong>The Great Ocean</strong> because it's the largest. <del><strong>Ikima</strong> is the south equivalent of our Atlantic Ocean on Earth - it's a large chunk of floating ice on the south of Ids</del>.</p>
<h2 id="political-overview-of-countries">Political Overview of Countries</h2>
<p><em>Three super-powers</em> on Ids (&quot;Present-day&quot;): <strong>Konralika</strong> <!--PENDING--></p>
<p>Ten other <em>minor-powers</em>: <!--PENDING--></p>
<h2 id="nations-of-kai">Nations of Kai</h2>
<h3 id="west">West</h3>
<h3 id="east">East</h3>
<h3 id="south">South</h3>
<h3 id="old-world-native-tribes">Old World (Native Tribes)</h3>
<p>Because of the power of believe and culture and traditions, unlike first nations on Tellus, those ancient tribes on Ids tends to have significant impact and political power to the entire Medalian civilization.</p>
<h2 id="country-lists">Country Lists</h2>
<p>There are at the moment (per year <em>35KYA-M</em> in the Medalian World) <em>76 (unified) nations</em> on Ids and spread across the major planets of the <strong>Doma System</strong>. Unlike earth nations, those Medalian nations occupy both (some exclusively) the land and the ocean - think in terms of Atlantis: <!--Notice country names may be well derived from native languages, i.e. other than the now-standard Medalian that we talk about, and names can come from dialects and all sorts of origins. So it's ideal to avoid having a single pattern among all those names. --></p>
<ol>
<li>Those on Amamu: <strong>Amuma</strong>,</li>
<li>Those on Amasia:</li>
<li>Those on Amabusa (largest): <strong>Konralika</strong></li>
<li>Those on Amajin (long strip):</li>
<li>Those on Akan (pole):</li>
<li>Those on Neyu:</li>
<li>Those on Ikima (ice):</li>
<li>Those on Ikisia (largest):</li>
<li>Those on Nabiusa:</li>
<li>Those not on Ids but mostly in neighbour moons or planets in Doma System:</li>
<li>The nations that's mostly established outside the Doma System:</li>
</ol>
<!--
(Note) 76 Nations (with either completely new or combined names; Names here grouped in generation scheme) (Notice that country names are NOT and should NOT be based on modern Medalian - most are historical and transliteration of its native language, aka. when making up those names we can be creative and not be restricted by Medalian language's framework and conventions): Amuma, Axi, Abahutan (Empire), Anti, Anzu, Anfuru, Auu, Biro (Birau), Banka, Culiva; Toihoma, Naxiji (Nashini), Zanbuco, Faxima (Fashima), Nan, Gonggi, Byuzan, Bayani, Hinduchi, Bəsaithang (Besizang); Liang, Kong, Jimuco 极木错, Santimau, Dangfu, Comoros, Farou, Kəmo, Sota 索他, Sanmugon 萨木供; Mad (Made), Araua (Aroa, Aroha), Zan, Təran, Vioti, Elfuta, Sistakanvita, Eswati, Naikrang (Nikrum), Natioura; Konralika "Imperial Court of Nations", ...

Pending assignment of **capital cities** (names and locations).
Pending enumeration of *22 smaller identities/countries*.

(collection, idea) Some additional town/city names: Pouma (博马) in Amamu, Busanlika (Named after Ora Busa Lika) in Amasia. Yuita on Yei, Dointan Ti Kamita on Fukxim, Uaikanminva on Naku, Chamurika on Zai, Xisai Kapla Ti Sevia (美姬陵) on Yei. 
(Collection, idea) Some additional location/region names: Cimaxu (瓷马墟)
-->
<p>On Ids, there are currently <em>15 native tribes</em> with considerable power remaining independent (of the unified nation): <!--Names derived from locations and a few are original.--></p>
<ol>
<li>Nanli</li>
<li>Dando in Amamu</li>
<li>Mango</li>
<li>Hangdu (Hanhdu)</li>
<li>Guangdu</li>
<li>Liangqu</li>
<li>Mang</li>
<li>Ukai</li>
<li>Lim</li>
<li>Sali</li>
<li>Solonia</li>
<li>Nati</li>
<li>Widow</li>
<li>Buma</li>
<li>Soulage</li>
</ol>
<p>The unification of nations are achieved through <strong>unions</strong>, <strong>treaties</strong> and <strong>organizations</strong>, instead of being identified as a single country.<br />
Those are the <em>7 big unions</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sintia De Nanlia</li>
<li>Sintia De Nabiusa</li>
<li>Sintia De Ids</li>
<li>Mufansa De Mangoi</li>
<li>Dalimuxin 大里木兴 (Da5Li2Mu1Xing5)</li>
<li>Akania</li>
<li>...</li>
</ol>
<p>There are 53 well-known <em>international and planetary organizations</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>International: <strong>Kaiodi</strong> <!--notice it's not "ai" but "a-i", this is almost like Kaiyodi, which is indeed its Romanization-->, Mindoi, Akanian, Borosia De Amaia, &quot;The Treaty of North Hemisphere&quot;, &quot;International Security Group&quot; ...</li>
<li>Inter-planetary: &quot;The Shrine of The Creators&quot;, &quot;Federal Association of Ids&quot;, ??? De Doma ari ??? (The Regislation/Federation of Doma and Beyond) &quot;The Regislation of Doma and Beyond&quot; ...</li>
</ol>
<p>On top of organizations and unions, there is such a thing as <strong>orders</strong> that establish themselves throughout history as an unofficial but strong power of control over regions and smaller powers - <strong>these forms the various Medalian Identities</strong>. Some of those orders, notably &quot;<em>The Consortium of Space Specie</em>s&quot; is directly involved with species apparently outside the Medalian World:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mufansa De Medala/The Medalian Order (aka. &quot;Medala&quot; when referring to the overall race) &quot;The Club of Medala&quot; 苏凡萨特麦达拉</li>
<li>Helaia De Kruk &quot;The Legacy of Kruk&quot;</li>
<li>Ikuria &quot;New Life Form&quot;</li>
<li>Xiramu &quot;The Beyond Persuit&quot;,</li>
<li>(Miah &quot;...&quot;)</li>
<li>.. De .. &quot;Interpreters of the Shrine&quot;</li>
<li>??? &quot;The Consortium of Space Species&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Further identities/organizations exist on colonized planets:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The Interplanetary Union&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The Galactic Trade Union&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Interplanetary Standard Issuer&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Peace Pact Associate&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Protector of the Union&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Interplantary Planning Associate&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Strange Matter Investigation Association&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;International and Cross-Planetary Firearm Control Group&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The Galactic Confederation&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The Shrine of The Creators&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The Council of Medalian Queens&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The Outer Idsans&quot;</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the most significant power entities - The Seven Queens of Medala <!--When you say those are "power entities", do you mean they each lead their own factions? That doesn't sounds stable for political power of the nation. Maybe they each lead a separate piece of geographically unconnected regions, e.g. island grounds, planets/astroids/moons, continents, sea cities, etc.--></p>
<ol>
<li>Ora (o2ra5) Busa Lika 欧拉布萨里卡 (from Konralika in Pouma in Amamu)</li>
<li>Ora Heya Yuit 欧若赫雅优衣特 (from Yuitan tribe in Amabusa)</li>
<li>Ora Heya Kamita 欧拉赫雅卡米塔</li>
<li>Ora Uaika (Waika) Minva (Mimva) 欧拉瓦以卡明娃</li>
<li>Ora Chamurika 欧若长幕瑞卡</li>
<li>Ora Sevia Tuma 欧拉赛维亚托玛</li>
<li><strong>Ora Sham Dζlinm (Deylim)</strong> 欧拉闪得琳 (Known as Doita Dəlin).</li>
</ol>
<!--Notice what's most well-known are their "Queen" names. Since they are most likely from around the system from different tribes (though notably from the more noble race of the dominant identity, i.e. Konralika), they most likely have their original names associated with their original identity - though such information is usually lost to the general public (still available on the book records and in the inner circle maybe) since they play little importance - queens in general share a single identity: **Doita De Medala**.-->
<h2 id="description-of-countries">Description of Countries</h2>
<!--Move to specific country's wiki-->
<p>Here is the enumeration and more-detailed (only serve as summary) notes of each country:</p>
<ul>
<li>??? (in ): ??? is among the 3 second-to-Konralika largest countries on Ids with considerable influence in Doma System in general, the other two being ??? and ???.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="biology">Biology</h2>
<!--Also see Cladogram-->
<p>Different continents have very different biomes (notably in animal species) due to the semi-independant nature of development (from sea lives) due to disconnection of some continents.</p>
<!--How many hominin species are there? I thought we said we wish there to be elemental.-->
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>Gold is an abundant resource on Ids. It's so much that it's almost used everywhere, and the color matches well with its largely sand-duned or red-volcano soil landscape.</p>
