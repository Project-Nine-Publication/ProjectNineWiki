<p>Earth, inside the Solar System in Milky Way, is exactly as established in Carl Sagan's Contact 1997. It's a planet (and system and galaxy) 36° from nominal top clock-wise (right-handed) to the nominal path of Medalian great expedition. The people living there are exactly like that on Earth, and two major events take place in the year 1997 or something: 1) Alien signal contact, 2) Travelling through man-made teleports and bypassing all gateways and eventually witness the civilization of an alien civilization that explores that &quot;Voyager Program&quot; for the lower civilizations. That quick-traveling gateways are borrowing the access of Medalian Gateways.</p>
<p>Notice this earth is FICTIONAL in the sense that we are stripping away lots of its culture and may apply with some modification as Tellus entities, and this earth is thus in a lot of sense different from our own Earth while Tellus feels more like (a completely fictional version) of our own earth. (We might need better clarification/definition on this concept)</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>(#20230906) We put Earth and Milky Way directly in P9 universe for two functions: 1) Serving mentioning value; 2) Making it explicit that neither Ids, Tellus, or Eva has anything to do with Earth and thus those planets and people living on them are completely indendent. Especially between Tellus and Earth - there may be similarities, but Tellus is NOT Earth.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>(#20230906) With the risk of being confused with our own Earth - this Earth is not the real-world earth!</li>
