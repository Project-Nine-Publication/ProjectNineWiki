            <p>(Things like this is very specific and should be handled in two aspects, both of which are independently maintained and serves different purpose: 1) This P9 Rev1 Text Wiki, which provides raw principle definition of all things; 2) Freehand/Scapple or other diagram formats, which provides straightforward one-glimpse view of current state of things.
In ths latter case, only names shall be mentioned and additional descriptions will have to see specific wiki entries eventually - on the other hand, a simple flat list of notes can be provided for quick indexing before things are moved to Wiki proper)</p>
<p>This wiki entry attempts to classify and provide a base framework or ALL SPECIES in the Project Nine World, and it specifically concerns: Animal kingdom (Animalia), plant kingdom (Plantae), fungus kingdom (Fungi), and maybe some other forms of life (Protista, Monera, and maybe other biological-like magical beings). It's divided into Medalian World and Tellurian World and concerns mostly life on Tellus and Ids but may also cover surrounding environments as well.</p>
<p>(WHAT'S OUR POLICY FOR ADDING NEW ANIMALS? DO WE NEED TO WORK OUT EVOLUTION PATH, MAKE EXPLICIT REFERENCE SOURCE, PROPOSE INITIAL VARIATIONS, AND PROVIDE HABITAT DETAILS, AND TAXONOMY? IS THIS DOCUMENT THE SOLE PLACE WE PUT SUCH IDEAS? WHAT ABOUT UNDEVELOPED IDEAS THAT WE MERELY SAW FROM OTHERS SKETCHES AND ONLINE PICTURES/WEB LINKS - WHERE DO WE PUT THOSE? WHAT COUNTS AS PROPER SOLIDIFICATION AS A SPECIES? WHAT COUNTS AS BEASTS?)</p>
<h2 id="convention">Convention</h2>
<p>The names are obviously tentative and not final - when things are close to finalized they will have their dedicated Wiki entries for expanded documentation. In the meantime, we use the following system for detailed taxonomy classification (<code>/</code> style classification system, e.g. <code>/Animal/Non-Mammal/Dinosaur</code>):</p>
<p>(Actually it's not possible to clearly differentiate, so we probably need a diagram of some kind to show this classification, in the meantime, we provide a flat list with basic classification ideas)
(See text references for reference of existing biological classifications)</p>
<ol>
<li>World: Tellurian or Medalian, or Others</li>
<li>Taxonomical Root: Biological Life (Biota/Vitae/Life); Notice we may also talk about Non-Biological Life (Digital, Cybernetic etc.) and Magical Life (Ghosts?) but they are not the focus.</li>
<li>Superdomains</li>
<li>Empires</li>
<li>Kingdoms</li>
<li>Phylum</li>
<li>Class</li>
<li>Order</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Genus</li>
<li>Species</li>
</ol>
<p>We may also label information regarding name, optional classifications, exstiction state, other labels, evolution parent, brief description, etc.</p>
<p>Worth talking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funfi (Teri)</li>
<li>Hominin</li>
<li>Microorganism</li>
<li>Other mammals</li>
<li>(Tellurs) Large Beasts</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="medalian-world">Medalian World</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Animal/Dinosaur-Like) Peridaro 闪电龙: 头上的双角可以制造（短暂的）高压闪电；坚硬无比。Real Life Source: Electric Eeel + Giant Dinosours.</li>
<li>(Animal/Insect) 圆蛛: (Ios, Dream Inspired, 20220403) (Animal) Spider like 4 leg olive size Sphroid (椭圆) hard shell insect animal (it also produces webs). It likes to hide into socks and bite/sting to Medalian feet.</li>
<li>(Animal) ???: (#Dream Inspired) (PENDING IDENTIFY SPECIFIC DREAM) Planet-wise network of deep tunnel tree-trunk size tentacle ass-holes.</li>
<li>(Hominin) Mint Green (Miah green female): A small patch of rounded bead like stony shinny particles under their eyes, reflective under sunshine. Greenish (nature) or Blueish (ice)? 碧绿/翠绿</li>
<li>(Hominin) Red: 赭红/褐红/殷红</li>
<li>(Ancient/Plant/Flower) Flamu (Fulamu) (Flaumu): A large 蕨类植物 whose flower's bud will generate light at night and attract small bugs - those bugs' feet got stuck on the surface of the flower and the flower eats them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tellurian-world">Tellurian World</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Animal/Fish) 金黄鱼: (P9, Tellus, 20220404, Dream Inspired) 金黄鱼，“台湾”区域沿海特长。小金黄鱼就有一个锅那么大，鱼肉鲜美可以炖汤，两面都是肉，切开无骨、便于食用。</li>
<li>(Animal/Mammal/Reptile) Dinosaurs: Some are mild and tamable, others are violent beasts. Egg born, must be tamed when bery young if tamable. Otherwise tempers varies (like horses).</li>
<li>(Plant) Mushroom Head 蘑萝头: Hard top fungi shell, walking animal, short form, large spam, very easily scared, eat small insects and plants.</li>
<li>(Plant) Swordgrass 磨骨草: White grass, spiky stem. Some varieties are super dry, 可入药。</li>
<li>(Plant) 纸莎草: Beautiful looking grass; Decorative, can be used to make paper and for decoration purpose. Pending Collection: <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B4%99%E8%8E%8E%E8%8D%89">https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B4%99%E8%8E%8E%E8%8D%89</a></li>
<li>(See Animal) Pearlfish: Arm-sized sea fish, long and slim body (but not as long as Pearlfish in our world). There is a 1-2cm pearl behind the mouth. Great trading fish both for the pearl and for the meat. The term &quot;Pearlfish&quot; might also refer to a class of fish - i.e. it's not a single species, pending a more formal latin name for that class.</li>
<li>(Sea Animal) Golden Orb Found at The Bottom of The Ocean (Pending collection: <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/golden-orb-found-at-the-bottom-of-the-ocean-mystifies-scientists">https://www.sciencealert.com/golden-orb-found-at-the-bottom-of-the-ocean-mystifies-scientists</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="universal-world">Universal World</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Alien Lifeform) Alien 1: Biosuit, no vocal cord and talk with telepathy (EM wave). Physical structure is actually quite weak without shield or under direct hit. (idea from) Independance Day 1996, but we are making their telepathy skill scientifically based on EM waves, like bats - so it's detectable. Alternatively, they can talk with a special type of vocal cords using supersonic - although justification is needed why don't they develop at least some form of &quot;common sound range&quot; that's shared by most animals which will give them evolutionary advantage when it comes to communicate (or simply scare off) other animals.</li>
