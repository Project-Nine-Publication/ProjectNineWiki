<p>神器不过是科技发达、制作复杂、独一无二。类似奇迹。技术上而言可以仿造，只是成本过于高昂——相比仿造，不如重新根据需要设计。长城是，Airi是，贝冶丹鼎是，时间加速器也是。神器不一定是界器，可以根据独特的功能来创建。神器往往倾国家之力多年、企业巨额投资在个体项目或者个人毕生心血打造。神器的复杂性可以是原理上的、结构上的（核聚变），或者单纯材料上的（例如核弹其实没什么结构复杂性）。但往往最好的效果是最简单的结构单纯大尺度堆积的结果，例如1.5 trillion parameter GPT model.</p>

<p>Legendary objects are contained within themselves the connection to the origin of worlds. Almost all legendary objects are directly or indirectly built by gods - or someone attaining the level of power as gods. Legendary objects are legendary/legend because: 1) They are one of a kind, 2) They are not usually seen, or may not even possess a physical form, 3) Their power (in terms of destructive or constructive) is at least comparable to a dozen countries' collective effort, in terms of power output, it's at least a few dozen nuclear power plants - some are even much more extraordinary; 3) It's possessed by a single (group of) person at a time, and thus the access to it is limited, 4) There are lots of tales/folklores/legends/myth surrouding the object and the object likely has a long history (&gt;2000 years); 5) Most original legendary objects are built by gods (Fepulans players), notably few exceptions are constructed by man (humans/tellurians, medalians, krukians) - actually maybe just Kun VI Chamurika and some Krukian genius; 6) They condese lots of energy/power/substance/structure within very limited space/form/shell. Due to their superbly powerful nature and high-level construct, those legendary objects can usually be put into a variety of ingenous use. However, they do have limits, and we typically very very rarely allow things that are galactical scale.</p>
<p>Here we mostly focus on things slightly outsid the Central Universe. For Fepulans players themselves are the definition of Gods and they can do things as dramatic and large scale as they wish - so within Central Universe aka. their playground things can get quite crazy.</p>
<p>Those are the legendary objects mentioned so far: <!--(Remark) Looks like modifing Innerworld's power to make legendary artifacts is a trend.--></p>

<li>Skydome is a legendary construct from intellect, and Mr. Leng obtained it from his dreams. It plays a very important role in establishing NFC's absolute defence. Notice Skydome is NOT visible. In terms of implementation, the Skydome could be a video game.</li>
<li>Portkey is a legendary construct by Fepulans hacker, and given to Medalian people a long time ago, and was first fully unlocked by Kun I.</li>
<li>Kun V's Neuroclenser (Resetting device) is a device that can (selectively) reset local spacetime.</li>
<li>Kun V/VII's Time Tunnel is a machine that when marked and timed exactly can teleport limited space of quantity into the past. This is legendary because it bakes directly into the spacetime and has the power to alter reality and is independent/outside the simulation even to Fepulan's wonder (though notably Fepulans never noticed it). The limit of this is rather obvious because you cannot just teleport to anywhere, and there are nots of risks and security issues in maintaining a plan.</li>
<li>In the old legends, NFC has this quantum-chamber that will infinitely scale up time inside, which may or may not be part of Skydome - could be an early independent prototype/development. To illustrate this as a story and to be meaningful (it's easily rendered meaningful if it's drawn as an illustration or mentioned in a sci-fi fantasy animation as some advanced tech, but in terms of writing, it requires a bit more exposure to make sense), so far the most reasonable way to look at it is that the device of of mild research interest and despite public news annoucement, due to limited access, few people outside academics/military/government is interested in it, because there are many other thigns going on in the world, and the world is big.</li>
<li>Some may claim every Xiramu is a legendary object in itw own, but they rarely participate in those mudane (世俗) matters, similarly, Fepulans players at high levels are also rather capable (for they ARE gods), but they also don't participate in matters outside the Central Universe.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice here we are documenting only true legendary objects, we are not documenting human-level magical/wonderous objects that may be exaggerated and called as &quot;legendary&quot;. This including all kinds of (Tellurian) magical artifacts and man-made objects that has magical or special technological powers, including Kun's Valkyria.</p>
