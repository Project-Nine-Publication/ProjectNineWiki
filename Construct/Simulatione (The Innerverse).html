<p>(Fepulans) Simulatione装置是一个人造的mini黑洞（因为如果用捕获的黑洞太大了也难以控制），所以得降维。(Mini)黑洞的Event Horizon是一种可编程的界限，黑洞内部有无限（可编程）可能。The difficult thing is not to send stuff in - it's literally a suck hole - but how to take stuff out: how to probe its states. There are certain states we can never know (like how's your favorite girl's first time who never liked you and is not talking to you any more). <!--(Remark, #20240311, Design) Instead of calling it a blackhole, which is a concrete solid construct existing in our universe and people with domain knowledge may find hard to accept, we should give it a dedicated alternative name, claiming it has properties similar to blackhole as we know it, but is nonethless a different thing that exists in their universe (aka. Fepulans). I.e. Make it clear it's an fictional concept, even though it's obviously derived from real world concept. Make it conceptually distinct.--></p>
<p>Only player information is managed in an object oriented manner, the rest of the simulation is just raw physical data, plus a bunch of rules that govern how they interact with each other.This is necessary,  because the simulation is fundamentally a bunch of mathematical equations, or fundamentally exists as mathematical constructs. This means depending on the specific information the operator is trying to query, it may or may not be straightforward to obtain such information. Of course, the information that is of particular research interest, or of player interest,  is always available because the necessary tools to access it have already been developed. The bottom line, for anything that is particularly new, or invented by the local inhabitants, The Fepulans will not have direct access to it,  or in other words, it is not possible to simply search for any specific given object. Also, it is worth noting that, as simulation-as-a-game goes, everything is physical based (like P9 The Matrix RTS) -  and there's no inherent concept of guilds, or ownership, or anything like that. As a physically based game, it can be rather “raw” - there is only player, and maybe shortcut ways to summon and construct materials.</p>
<p>Despite some similarities of the overall structure and evolution of the Simulatione universe - and despite more closely borrowing entities like Earth and Milky Way directly in-world. The Simulatione iS NOT our universe and is logically and structurally fundamentally different - it's this structural and functional difference that gives reason to the in-world reality of various functionings of the Simulatione universe.</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<p>Also mentioned as &quot;The inner universe&quot; in earlier notes (consider replacing the word &quot;Simulatione&quot; with a medalian word to refer to the universe, and then refer to the body of my Project Nine text notes as Simulatione).</p>
<ul>
<li>The Inner Universe/The Innerverse: Refers to the Simulatione. In contrast to &quot;The Outer Verse&quot;; Related to &quot;Portkey&quot;.</li>

<li>(Medalian) &quot;Eternal Fake&quot; -&gt; &quot;Eternal Flake&quot;: PENDING</li>

<p>The universe has multiple layers - it's not just <em>this universe</em>, but layers of encompassing structures of <em>universes within universes</em> (ideally only one unique instance at each layer due to resource restrictions).</p>
<p><strong>The Fepulans</strong> (<em>The Gods</em>) created our universe, call it <em>The Universe</em> or <em>The Innerspace</em>; The Fepulans also created <em>the artifact</em> (called <strong>Portkey</strong>), which has a seemingly disapparate but connected spaces called the <strong>Inner World</strong>. The universe where the Fepulans live in is called <em>The Outer World</em>. The purpose of the Fepulans to create our universe is to <em>find a solution to their own imminent problem</em>. The intellectual curiosity, however, eventually leads to them investigating how intelligent are those beings of creation - can they comprehend and communicate with their higher being? That gives rise to deploying Portkeys while not severely disturbing the natural order of things (just imagine you created a computer game and one of those days the NPC startings talking to you). For financial and other reasons, the simulation also became an <strong>online game</strong>, accessible by ordinary Fepulans people - those <strong>Travelers</strong> has unusual power than ordinary beings in this dimension.</p>
<p><del>Humans and <strong>Medalians</strong> have this very intimate connection through blood and ancestry in terms of that: Medalians are descendants of <strong>the Neanderthals</strong>.</del></p>
<p>There are many many more (very bizarre) civilizations other than Humans and Medalians out there, widely spread in the universe. Among those are at least these types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Original biological forms, among which terrains are <em>one of the few the most advanced</em> in terms of intelligence and evolution. Lots of life forms out there are very basic due to natural barriers of the nature and the universe;</li>
<li>The civilization entity collectively known as <em>&quot;The Medalians&quot;</em>, which spans across several artificial species;</li>
<li><strong>The Guests/The Travelers</strong> that are impostors of the players from The Outer World;</li>
<li>Artificial, experimental (non-carbon) life forms fabricated by the Fepulans for experiment purpose.</li>
<li>The Central Stage of the Universe - the most densely populated region of the universe, with many empires, kingdoms and civilizations, originating from seven selected species.</li>
</ol>
<p>We propose there were in fact <em>seven</em> civilizations advanced enough to deserve attention from The Gods (The Creators/Fepulans) - each one of them received an artifact, and each of those artifact is likely to <em>cause long-lasting impact on the civilization and enduring long-lasting warfares</em>. To simplify matters and avoid unnecessary arbitrariness, all those artifacts have similar functionalities: they are keys to unlock supreme channels to outer worlds and unworldly powers. (Comment, #20230630) I hate this idea of Portkeys. Feels very unnatural and not cool and disobeys physics. We might want to reduce relying on this concept.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>When The Creator accidentally initiated the simulation program 13.8 billion years ago, our universe was born through a sequence of randomized parameterization. 9.257 billion years later, our planet Earth was formed in the galaxy of The Milky Way. In year 36,759 BCE, The Creator moved half of the Neanderthal population at that time to a remote planet located in the galaxy of Andromeda 2.57 million light-years away named Kai. That is the origin of the first generation of Medala people.</p>

<li>ts U-2000000. event &quot;Before the Beginning of Time&quot;. tag &quot;#Fepulans World&quot;. overview &quot;ProtoOrder: -2000000&quot;
note &quot;Is this part even imaginable? <!--Yes it certainly is: see 缥缈之旅. Though the physics part needs more work.-->&quot;
note &quot;(Idea) The physics at the very early quanta-seconds of time is very very complicated - both in this world and in the world outside. There is only one thing known to be sure: there is no less and no more activities than what is going on in every cubic inch of space in the present world than in the ancient world.&quot;</li>
<li>ts U0. event &quot;At the Beginning of Time&quot;. tag &quot;#Fepulans World&quot;. overview &quot;ProtoOrder: -1000000&quot;.
describe &quot;(Fact) According to <cite><em>The Dialogue with Our Creators</em></cite> by first Medalian Queen <strong>Ora Busa Lika</strong>: Fepulans, an unknown higher-dimensional entity, started the simualtion of this universe. The purpose of this simulation, according to Lika, is to <cite><em>experiment and explore the extent/physique/meaning of 'that' universe</em></cite>. And for that reason, <cite><em>the/your species (either humans or medalian) carries the key to solve the power/puzzle</em></cite>.&quot;
describe &quot;(Mythology) According the the myth after <strong>The Age of Awakening</strong> (after first Queen), (Medalian) legend has it that our creators created 3 different worlds: <em>the known medalian world</em>, <em>the known unknown Human world</em>, and <em>the unknown unknown Egg world</em> - different species evolve from those worlds, and those worlds might exist either <em><cite>within</cite></em> (our universe) or <em><cite>without</cite></em> (in separate universes). The legend has it that our creators are some captured being by some great evil named <cite><em>The Dongdu (Dong3du5)</em></cite>, and they created us in order to study a way out of their capturing.&quot;</li>
<li>F17.01 Imminent Financial Issue. Tags: Fepulans World. ProtoOrder: -990000. 10 Seconds After The Creation of The Universe: The <strong>Research Center for Metaphysical Studies</strong> runs into financial issue, they changed simulation step from an earlier one to the current one and reduced simulation speed (by providing less power) by <em>9/10</em>, which causes significant changes to the <strong>microstructure of the universe</strong>, which, surprisingly, also helped the formation of later universe.</li>
<li>F17.03 First Search by The Outer World. Tags: Fepulans World. Date: ???. Keywords: ??? ProtoOrder: -950000. <strong>The Outer World (650KYA (Earth Time))</strong>: The Creators discovered <strong>The Milky Way</strong> and planet <strong>Tellus</strong> after searching for roughly <em>3 Fepulans Months</em> (less than <em>7604 years on earth</em>, with pauses), after studying it for another <em>15 Fepulans months</em> (less than <em>38021 human years</em>, with pauses), they decided to perform some experiments with available life forms on Earth.
<ul>
<li>The experiment was three stages:
<ol>
<li>They copied half the species on earth and moved them to a planet in a remote galaxy about <em>3 million light years</em> away from The Milky Way in the <strong>8th quandrant</strong> per <strong>GM8 coordinate system</strong>.</li>
<li>They moved specifically first <strong>Australopithecus Afarensis</strong> then <strong>Neanderthals</strong> to the <strong>Doma system</strong> in <strong>M31</strong> <!--Notice Fu Zhiyi (Jay) mentioned that Andromeda might be too much abused so we might not want to use Andromeda - even considering the fact that Andromeda is the nearest with the most abundant known information so its travel time is reasonable. Charles.Zhang, 12/28/2021-->.</li>
<li>They experimented with some biologically based synthesized-designed species somewhere unknown in the universe (notice this is different from their earlier experiments using strange matters).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>F17.08 First Financial Dilemma. Tags: Fepulans World. ProtoOrder: -980000. 1 Billion Years after The Big Bang: In order to reduce operational cost and get finer details of simulation observation, they they further <em>change simulation speed</em> from an earlier one to the current one, and decide to drop all matters at the edge of the simulation boundary somewhat <em>200 billion light years</em> away from <strong>COU (Center of the Universe)</strong> (notice expansion of universe cause total size larger than theoretical travel distance of light).</li>
<li>F17.12 Opening of Simulation as Game. Tags: Fepulans World. Keywords: Finance. ProtoOrder: -970000. <strong>2.5 Billion Years after The Big Bang</strong>: The Research Center for Metaphysical Studies runs into financial issue. They sell some unoccupied spaces to the general public for entertainment, private research and other business with limited access controls. This also causes &quot;<strong>The Boom of Worlds</strong>&quot; where Fepulans' creativities went wild and people use their worlds to do crazy things.
<ul>
<li>Magic (the non-technical sort, aka. Not the kind of <em>concentrated Energy</em>) might have been introduced at this time.</li>
<li>(A more rich-person jargon would be instead of calling this a &quot;game&quot;, call it a &quot;sport&quot;; Like how rich people call toy boats and aircrafts as sports because they are expensive.</li>
<li>As a sport, there are entry barriers and challenges when participation: 1) It costs money, 2) To keep diving in this world requires sustaining hardware (much like oxygen tank etc.) or at least the initial equipment cost is super high, 3) One must go through rigorous training etc. in order to get used to the particular environment that enables &quot;diving&quot; into this sub-world - symbolically, we can require a special hardware setup that kind of immerse the user under liquid tanks in order to submerge, 4) There is danger and risk of getting hurt when not operated appropriately or overlonged session of exposure or dangerous actions within the sub-world may inadvertly impact the host, or simply the mind may &quot;drift-away&quot; for unknown reason during the practice of submerging - likely due to time dilation between the simulated world and the Fepulans world)</li>
