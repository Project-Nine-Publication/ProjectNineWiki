<p>Celetial beings possessing massive energy and the ability of transformation.</p>
<p>Naming: Celestial Being. They have a spawner hub, aka. &quot;The Heaven&quot;, which is quite big and contains many parts.</p>
<p>Most of those celetial beings live on a different time scale than us and don't really interfere with our every day world, because their decision making frequency is so much slower than us because the simulation speed is much faster than their world.</p>
<p>Some players however, are fully immersive, in that they literally live in this world - this is one potential temporary solution to their existence crisis, by slowing down the time it take for them to extinguish.</p>

<p>The Fepulans players are NOT absurd concept - they represent the fact that even though some are concerned with their own petty things, there are games being played at different levels: from atmoic to cellular to personal to organizational to social to cultural to regional to political to international to interstellar to The Beyond. Aka. there is always something bigger, and there is intervined interaction, that are &quot;intelligent&quot; and logical in its own ways.</p>
