<p>Sex is noble, not morally, but in the sense of the final &quot;reward&quot; - the creators gives us the final pleasure as a reward for achieving the noble goal of delivery life to the next generation. On Tellus, due to mystical/magical reasons, sex can have the following three consequences:</p>
<ol>
<li>(Planted behavior) “大盲” (refers to the spiritual/religious aspect of it)： One or both of the partners will not reach ejaculating orgasm and will die after performing a &quot;programmed procedure&quot;, which is to push away the other party, hold his/her hand, and die lying down peacefully with a 大-shape posture. Lots of couples are discovered died this way. Happens to 1/3 or 1/5 of population. See wiki entry Euphthansia on the death/spiritual aspect of it.</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>(Intellectural/Natural behavior) “超生”： Per Merveil experience, sex with true love has transcendental effect and immediately grants magical powers to the beloved two. Happens to 1/10 of population. This will happen immediately when it's with the right person at the right moment. Generally speaking, it will happen at first sex with someone new or with a person after a long break (so long that it's capable of changing each others' altitudes on things), i.e. if two have been having sex for a long time and this didn't happen then it's not likely to happen. Such an enlightening effect is called 不疑之征.</li>
<li>Just regular boring, exciting, routine sex, likely capable of giving birth to a child if no protection was used. Happens to majority of population.</li>
</ol>
<p>From above we can derive the following special properties/derivations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unvaccinated sex worker in Tellus is both life-threatening, and both life enabling.</li>
<li>There is a drug (Supressor) that will prohibt death but also suprress the ability to obtain &quot;enlightening&quot;. It's either taken regularly, before sex, one week before sex (like Prep), or through some continue injection or even small operation to completely eliminate the risk.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exposition">Exposition</h2>
<p>In terms of writing, one way to truly expose such phenomenon is through the narration of a single personality experiencing sex with different women in this order: regular, Merveil experience, death. We need to focus on how emotions/bonds/attachments are built during the process, personality and altitudes of the other party, and most importantly how the two eventually get hooked up.</p>
