<p>This is a Tellurian-specific construct. Programmed Procedure is a special sequence of actions conditioned on specific contexts and will happen when triggered and before death. Those proceures are powerful symbols in that they are observable by outsiders and leads to certain death.</p>
<p>Below are the scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>Certain sex situations: the person will push away the other and lie down peacefully while holding hands. The person will not think of anything specific.</li>
<li>Mervil experience: the person will sit up, raise right hand, and speak a sequence of words. The person will think of very briefly his past life, or most recent life activities.</li>
</ol>
