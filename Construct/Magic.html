<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic&quot; - Clarke's Third Law
No one will question why your world has so many different types of systems if your world is cool/good/wild enough. - Me.
The majority of the world doesn't depend on magic or superstitious or non-essential constructs and is completely sci-fi driven. Magical/Legendary elements are either completely trivial and plays the role of arcane/religious studies, which may be known to majority but practised by few, or they play substantial one-time modification/change roles to a large part of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are three or more forms of magic in our system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Daoism/玄幻修真/传统仙侠</li>
<li>西游记、日本鬼怪精灵</li>
<li>Western traditional fantasy (Tolkien The Lord of the Rings, and mostly from Japanese-derived western magical world like Fate Zero)</li>
<li>Modern day science</li>
<li>Sci-fi and super sci-fi</li>
<li>Outer world sci-fi, Fepulans Players in Innerworld</li>
<li>Redream, Higher Level of Consciousness, The Many Worlds</li>
<li>Xiramu and other higher constructs</li>
</ol>
<p>The single central connecting pillar among all those will be the productivity, storage, conversion rate of energy, and that of matter. Mor especifically, conservation of energy and momentum and matter is always respected (even for Fepulans players). That is, any individual or container may possess such properties that it is capable of producing, storing, and transforming between matters and energy. The affinity to certain elements/energy forms/matters ARE ULTIMATELY nothing more than potential energy as stored in mechanical forms (through matter) or dynamic energy as stored as a result of movement - thus determines the efficiency of the application of various forms. All elements (mechanicam forms) are classified under a &quot;periodic table&quot; just like that of the periodic table in chemistry. We will enumerate all such energies and forms in latter sections. Entities like Fepulans players can be treated as super-conductors, super-reactors and super-containers, where on its own is a shell of an extraordinary amount of energy and power, which gives it the capacities to do all kinds of weird stuff - the key is while they are doing those weird stuff, we need to accurate depict what happens in nature, and how natural physical phenomena respond to their actions physically.</p>
<p>In summary, the basic design principles concerning magic is that: 1) Fundamental physics must be conserved (as observed by us within this world): including conservations of all measure PLUS fundamental forces. 2) If there is magic it must be universal and animal-based (biological)；兽有兽性，不可与人共通（除非伴生种类）<!--(Remark, #20230308) Actually I am not entirely sure what the sentence "兽有兽性，不可与人共通" means.-->. 3) The transformation and storage of energy MUST HAVE PHYSICAL FORMS; For example, there cannot be &quot;ghosts&quot; without a tangible physical form and completely invisible - it's possible to have a non-conscious blob of energy light, or an exact replica of human form, but it cannot be nothing existing nowhere yet also somehow self-organized and possess consciousness. As a general rule of thumb of our magical framework: it's going to be tool/equipment/gadget based, in that all manners of magical powers are weld through a rigorous sequence of applying dedicated tools to supply transformation and achieve target effects, instead of incantation or mental recitations. The most fundamental way for Tellurians to make use of magic is to store magical energies in its body, and channel it (through physical contact, like pouring water into pipes) through magical-intake devices which performs the actual transformations of all kinds.</p>
<p>Magic education: Learning magic is hard, expensive, requires intelligence/interest/nurturing/talents, and may or may not work out for everyone to great extent. We should analogy it as engineering, singing/drawing, and programming. For instance, everyone once in a while especially when very young would be genuinely or at least somewhat interested in singine/drawing/dancing/engineering/programming/tarot/astrology/divination/etc., and they did learn or pick up a few terms from it but due to lack of exposure and due to latter life/career/work/romance/education paths they are distracted from it and use it less and less and eventually they come to a state that: 1) They forgot the little they've learnt when young, 2) They do not have time or context or resources to learn it for there is no context to apply and use it, 3) They are afraid or not willing to or lost interest learn. Like those skills, magic can be divided into (pending terminologies) theories and practice (some of those include divinity and religious studies, ancient gods and histories, occultism and mysticism, necromancy and Demonology/通灵或问米, divination/astrology and tarot/palm/leaf/smoke reading/风水, Witchcraft and wizardry, Alchemy, Shamanism and Esotericism and Voodoo and Wicca, Enchantment/Runes and Blessing/Clairvoyance, Sorcery and spellcasting, Rituals/Mediumship and summoning/Conjuring and invocation, and theurgy). Really useful and larger-scale ones are arcane and requires deep studies and sophisticated practices (like making a good concept art) and preparations, and the field is highly specialized (e.g. diviner work for large government and political organizations), which makes it harder to laymans to get into. One may occassionally pick up one or two theories or one or two practices that can be used as tricks in real life, but general &quot;application&quot; of the the techniques are a domain-specific practice (e.g. divination for fortunes of maritime is different from agriculture activities). Any other &quot;cool&quot; magic usually require expensive materials for necessary energy storage and expense or MANY YEARS of cultivation training to gain any effect. More likely than not, when using external materials, mechanisms are required in order to release energy stored in crystallized forms (like chemistry). So even though everyone may know magic, and everyone is aware of the diverse applications of &quot;magic&quot; in everyday life (e.g. political manuvour, military use), for the most part, such magical applications do not directly interfere with ordinary people's life, with the exception of a few very wide-practiced traditions (e.g. rituals for good health) and inventions (e.g. some of the very very small scale elemental gadgets e.g. to start a fire or something). Like all other modern day subjects (including arts &amp; science &amp; engineering &amp; finance), colleges dedicated to the theory and practice related to magic are set up - and it's not untill such post-secondary serious studies does one gain true applicability of the craft, otherwise high schools and general pubbic education just provides very rudimentary history and high level theory lessons on the subject without teaching how to actually apply and use it (like how high school teaches physics and chemistry without relate it to actual engineering practices). The limits of Tellurian bodies means each individual can generally do VERY little - usually some kind of &quot;medium&quot; device is needed (like a super powerful and sophisicated magical wand which is NOT going to be simply a wood plus a simple dragon string or whatever). Not untill latter sci-fi cultivation stage and through other specialized traditional training can a person change the physical structure of its body significantly (while maintaining mental integrity) and began to truly become powerful.</p>
<p>Due to its general lack of accessibility, those who practice the arcane art might be considered a marginalized group and have very weird social status - in some countries they are highly valued (like trades of crafts), while in other countries they live at the bottom of the society and are not valued. It's like craftsmanship - every country and every one needs them, but especially with industrialization, the majority of most household's needs can be satisfied and especially in modernized cities are indeed satisfied directly through mass productions, and the demands for hand-crafted magical properties drop. Those who practice the arcane art are like those who practice magic (as in our world, aka. sleigh of hand), or those who serve very very specific and specialized consultation roles, or like those for arts and cinematography or stunts education. People see them on TV and in films a lot but that's the extent of it. One way to calculate how many people actually possess this skill is to consider along those: 1) For a 2-3 months level crafting skill, how many people can easily obtain in our world? E.g. mechanical operations, racing car driving, or beauty hosts. That's every adult, then what kind of aptitude (e.g. outstanding genetics, beauty, wealth) is required? That will significantly cut how many people can actually enter this field even if it's trivial to learn; 2) For 1-4 years crafting skill, how many people can easily affort a college/university level equivalence? Only 38 percent of populate can enter college in North America, and you need to further divide this to allow them picking other more practical fields due to demands of jobs and personal interests; 3) For 15+ years crafting skill for more advanced and truly master-grade appliance, how many people can sustain training and practice that long? This one is harder to estimate and we need some numbers on available (hand-crafting) artisans and advanced designers/engineers (with more than 15+ of experience) in our world - also notice this will likely be highly specialized to a field or even specific application. E.g. Dumbledore might be good with fire magic but not so much with water magic, and there are only 2914 bridge engineers in North America (though notably with more than 16K job openings related to the field), and those will further be allocated to bridge design, maintainence and other misc. work. (We would also like to learn how many bridges are currently under construction at a given year and how many engineers it requires to design a bridge and monitor the construction of a bridge)</p>
<p>Here are some likely and very specialized applications of magic, arcane art, or the magical background of the Tellurian world:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ancient beasts along with large dinosours and dragons shape a dangerous and exciting world that humans will try to control and protect themselves from.</li>
<li>Performance arts, like in a circus, or as some kind of show.</li>
<li>Very specialized military force and close-combat.</li>
<li>Magical item design, manufacturing, maintanence.</li>
<li>Magical education, magical research, including history and the development of new magics; Academic research also includes classifications of magic.</li>
<li>Mining/Hunting/Surveying of magical resources.</li>
<li>Magic standardization, regulation, law making. Magical reporting require people with specialized knowledge, and there may not even be enough people working in those 文书 positions if the overall magical community is small.</li>
<li>Magical enforcement (magic police).</li>
<li>News and media companies may have dedicated magical columns or consultants for magical affairs (depending on what kind of magic there is and whether they are directly related to and will interfere with ordinary citizen life).</li>
<li>(Individual) Magical services.</li>
</ol>
<p>We need to consider whether the following categories are considered viable in our magical world, in what form, and how: <!--Notice the goal besides finding a consistent physically based framework is, more importantly, establish our own self-consistent and cool style--></p>
<p>(Provide in-paragraph description of those topics and whether or not they are viable as worldly reality in our world and to what extent do they apply. Notice some of them may ONLY be legends, superstitions, folklore, and can appear in popular media as part of people's story life, but not as physical reality, e.g. things like predicting future, and things like goblins etc.)</p>

<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>At the moment, we haven't decided how magical should Tellus vs Medala be, or should different continents on Tellus compare to each other; It's easier to imagine Tellus as a globalized economy and technology/culture are uniform on large scales and it fits better into our view of the current world, at least in terms of the precence of magic.</li>
<li>We need to discuss: what kind of individuals under what circumstances can weld such powers, to what extent can such magical power be weld by humans i.e. the scale and magnitude on a single individual, how common place is the utilization or fighting done with such powers, how much destructive power are such forces and how much energy drain does it has on individuals that utilize them, to what extent such powers can be controlled through will alone (after training) i..e do they require some form of operational mediums (like a magic wand). In a world that is pretty much 武侠/仙侠/玄幻, talented individuals might carry on fights and national missions like ninja world depicted in Naruto.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dated-notes">Dated Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(#20230731) The exact mechanism of certain magical elements work DO NOT NEED TO BE FIGURED OUT, and they simply SHOULD NOT BE FIGURED OUT. E.g. Blessings. Some forms of blessings may have explanable mechanisms, but in general this is a concept that is just taken to be true.</li>
<li>(#20231125) 有一流派相信可以把情绪通过培养提炼成彩色的石头。Those could be made into intricate decorations. However, when told to others who don't believe in this, it's like telling them there is god, or there is buddha - sounds superstitious. (20231125 unrecorded dream inspired)</li>
<li>(#20231226, Comment, Review) Why do we have magic? Because there is god, and god uses magic. However ordinary people cannot wield magic because it's too convenient - it's however arcane and available to few. On the other hand, &quot;magic&quot; is implemented like technology. ¶Why do we have god? Because that's premise and foundation of Mefalian-Krukian conflict.¶The question is not why we have it but how.</li>
<li>(20250501) Per 阿卡西记录 (those knowledge from spontaneous study are attributed to accessing a collective knowledge base), unified world, higher consciousness, always-existing-entity and connection, and a natural sepration between those more incliend to left brain (the 智能者) and those more incliened to right brain (the 灵能者) and those in hermits betewen (the 慧能者) - the battle has been since ancient time. We will exaggerate the scale/scope/influence of those  who specialize in such magical practices and make it a first-class norm on Tellus, until aliens arrive, and we will have another norm, concerning higher order tech and civilization (also we will make sure Medalians absolutely do not talk about &quot;spirit&quot; in the same manner as on Tellus but more scientific and technical).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design-philosophy">Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>The magical world, the magical elements, or the magical system in Project Nine world avoids the &quot;traditional&quot; 5-elemental structure (however it might be part of the in-world alchemy or traditional magical history anyway) because it's just tooooo cliche and do not feel new. That is, we avoid the concept of &quot;elemental magic&quot; in general - unless in rare occassions we have better ideas to present it, e.g. in the form of animal magics (kind of like Pokemon).</p>
<p>Inspired by The Martian 2011, our magic systems is scientifically calculable by describing them with numbers and units.
The fundamental design approach for &quot;non-elemental magic&quot; is that we should always <em>find a substitutable mechanism instead of relying on raw magic</em> for the specific effects. For instance, there is no need for spirit/ghost/mind if everything can be explained with brain alone, e.g. 魂器作为记忆的不完全拷贝，而此次上成为一种metaphor。</p>
<p>(Comment, #20230628) Around June we come up with the idea of name/identify our magics as &quot;forces&quot; instead of &quot;elements&quot;. E.g. stuff like &quot;疾&quot;, &quot;长&quot;, &quot;滞&quot;, etc. We had some fragmented notes on this (pending identification).</p>
<h2 id="case-studies">Case Studies</h2>
<h3 id="harry-potter-and-wands">Harry Potter and Wands</h3>
<ul>
<li>Incantation in the form of Harry Potter is just memoric device. Raw and ancient magic requires no wand and murmuring. Having such is said to simplify things, for most, and for beginners, but not for all. The intricate thought process, on the other hand, cannot be spared.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="non-elemental-magic">Non-Elemental Magic</h2>
<p>(Comment, #20230703) I think I have another note on this providing a few initial force forms, now I cannot find it. Find it and put it here.</p>
<p>Here are a few additional force forms: corruption, forge, combine, break-apart, fusion, growth, cure. Note that several different force forms can potentially achieve the same effect, e.g. cure a wound can be done both with forge, growth and cure.</p>
<h2 id="secrets">Secrets 秘术奥义</h2>
<p>Such secrets are ancient practices (that happen to work REALLY WELL in Tellus world) of great strategical value and passed throughout generations as secret traditions and never taught to the outside public.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Feudal Japan) (鸟语术): Rumoured to be used in military and originated from ancient practices, a group/family of feudal japan (who nobody knows which exactly) can communicate with birds - specifically, song sparrows. They can thus send messages this way discretly.</li>
<li>(???) (Snake): Some people can really command snakes to do certain things. Though since snakes cannot communicate, it's a bit hard to pass information this way - but they can let the snakes lead ways.</li>
<li>(China) (Tai Chi): A school of martial arts that combines both &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;strong&quot;. It's a superior form of non-weapon close combat.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="genealogy">Genealogy</h2>
<p>The general forms of magic are such that: they are either instantaneous (and extraodiry), or they are consistent and self-sustained by Nature. For instance, a spark of lightening can be considered magic because it's instance, and a glowing stone can be considered magic because it's self-sustained by nature untill some external forces come to disturb its equilibrium. On the other hand, neither digital computer or liquid hydrogen propulsion rockets are magic because they are neither extraordinary (they are just large-scale, whilst based on smaller and more fundamental physical principles and the ingenius of engineering) or self-sustained by the power of Nature.</p>
<p>On the other hand, all magic must be observable from nature: dragons are derivations of birds, fire/water/lightening/air/earth/metal are all real, flying is observed from birds (again), fast movements are observed from animals and other things, and tremendous amount of Natural powers are observed from our nature - hence all magic are by observation must be derived from nature. What is special when it's being deployed as an instrument in fiction is that humans, individuals, or specific objects or items can weld such power from with its own will - it doesn't matter what medium is required: a wand, a spell, a 符咒, a gesture, a sound, an instrument, or anyother format - ultimately, the external shapes and forms and flourishes are ALL insignificant and ultimatelly its the users' active will and willingness to use such power that made it happen.</p>
<p>Magic must have an energy source and such an energy source MUST be controllable through certain interface by its user - unless when such an energy source is the user itself in which case it can be controlled directly through Will alone. Hence all magic that comes from nowhere and costs no effort or relies on no medium are NOT applicable under our framework, and LOL style &quot;magic has an energy source but the rest is pretty much arbitrary&quot; also doesn't work in our framework. Basically, the only mechanisms that magic can work in our frameowrk is either: 1) The caster itself is a storage and active user of magic; 2) The caster itself interacts with some objects (in physically plausible way rather than through mind) which has the power to cast magic directly. Like Rick summons portal through Portal gun, which has the capacity to shoot portals, which are themselves self-sustained physical effects powered by Nature.</p>
<p>The world must already be exhibiting magic on an observable scale, so humans can learn and imitate and develop magic. That is, in a magical world, it must NOT be that humans are the only one that is actively using magic - animals and the nature itself must already be magical. For instance, if a vehicle is to be floating through magical means, then there will be mountains and trees that's already floating; If a person shall be able to transform earth or enhance growth of plants through chanting, then there must already be animals that can freeze water and flourish plants.</p>
<p>The fundamental framework is that the magical reality implies that the physical world is not the only world - (like in Spinoza Ethics) there are layers of simultanenous physical, spiritual and metaphysical worlds. Where the spiritual world is like physical world, dominates most parts of physically interactable magic; The metaphysical world is unlike physical world and do not have the concept of space or time. Black holes and dark energy are manefects of such an unseen non-physical world.</p>

<p>P9 Magic generic 真原力/真元力 framework (main inspiration is 飘渺之旅 which makes more sense than weird gesture based magic): unseen, mind controlled, malleable form, can interact with the real world.
(Consider merging with the anime movie concept) Density, affinity and amount is the only attributes that matters in practice - no DIRECT force feedback through utilizing such energies. (i.e., If someone enters a force field populated with such power, the user won't realize it immediately until she scans for field distribution changes)</p>
<h2 id="general-notes">General Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unlike 缥缈之旅, the magical power flows through all kinds of animals and beings and is NOT restricted to humans or intelligent animals - though the forms and formats can differ. But it doesn't mean that less intelligent animals will not have intricate applications of such powers - in fact, evolution will make sure that other animals make use of their powers as intelligently though may less malleable than humans.</li>
<li>It might seem that the concept of magic makes more sense on the (larger) planet of Ids instead of Tellus? For instance, the idea of an (elemental) magic school and ghost town seem to make more sense in a Medalian context rather than a Tellurian context. Besides, Medalians needs romance - they have a much longer history than Tellurians, and their world is filled of stories. Along this line, we can think of Tellus is a heavily 偏科 location where for historical and globalization reasons, the entire planet tends towards technological advancements instead of the other direction of development - on the contrary, the Medalian world is more well balanced and more extreme where all threads of development, be it traditional or modern, all have significant followers - maybe because it's larger, and thus regions are historically more isolated with abundant resources and individually developed, and had less impact from colonization. Also, to make it distinct and explicit: the concept of gods and godly realms should also be used in the context of Medalian worlds (in that case, the idea of My Yakuza Girlfriend might need some modification).</li>

<li>(Magic) If we are going to have &quot;magic&quot; then it would be energy-based and combat type. The most it can be without breaking sense is shape transformation type. There should generally be no biological, psychological and spatial-temporal or spiritual magic.</li>
<li>(Magic) The focus and culminating of combat magic might be Elemental Magic and Enhanced Elemental Magic - specifically, fire, water and air. Once we can gain control with parametrizable-property of elemental power, we cna use the combination of fire, water and air to do many many things. To scale up is the next stage, called Large-Scale Elemental Magic, and to allow transformation is called Morohable Elemental Magic. Much more advanced property shaping is available through Advanced Morphing Magic; More advanced behavior control is available through Behavioral Elemental Magic. Another subbranch is called Force Field Magic. Body-enhancement through magic is broadly studied under Avatar Magic or Nanomorphology, notably (Nano) Skin Morphology. Combat skin design is studied under Effect Layer Control. A new and emerging branch is called Permanent Magic Studies, which tries to generate long-term magical effects on human skins, sort of like Morphology but it tries to permanently enhance performance. Master of Magical Operations is the training of using and applying magic, while Master of Magical Design is focusing on researching new application.</li>
<li>(Magic) Anything that is beyond the standard of the scope of our magic here, might be implemented through technological means.</li>
<li>(Magic, Name, Linguistics, Specification) We should not use &quot;magic&quot; in our (Simulatione) world, to differentiate the usual connotation of it from our implementation - instead, it should go alone the line of &quot;generative/growing/substance power/force&quot;, which should be a 1-2音元语素, because it's considered as part of natural evolution and have been with humans for a long time. Recommendations (from &quot;naturalis potentia&quot; natural power): nat, natia, natilas (adj. natiliar).</li>
<li>(Magic, Reference) Look at FF XV Kingsglaive - it's predominantly medieval with modern archtecture and vehicles (with some of its cities look just like a Cyberpunk style); Maybe for NFC we can predominantly sci-fi with magic? Think in terms of the Dream Inspired magical school in the middle of a modern town, and we can have more subtle balances here and there, e.g. in terms of energy measures and limits like such.</li>
<li>(Magic, Rule, Model, Measure, Physics, Principle, History, #Development, Anthropology) (The Medieval Times) If the world has magic, we might consider support it from ground up: imagine burning witches and wizards in public for their sin with this haystack hire. Young kids show signs of magic early on (like being a gay), and during the early times it's considered a sin or a crime in many regions of the world - because of lack of understanding of this, accidents happen a lot - <em>fire attribute is the most abundant magic form, second corruption, third water/ice/weather, forth wind, fifth metal, sixth growth</em> - families and homes are burned down and torn apart. Most people learn to hide their traits of magic early on. Magic during this time is an uncontrollable substance, like vermines or disease - and it's said to be transmissive (which is true, since everyone kind of have the potential for magic: this is rendered just as most of us can dream and even have lucid dreams during our youth, but later on we LEARN to forget), and even worth - if one doesn't learn to control magic, magic will take control over the host - not necessarily mentally, but at least physically, consuming the host, filled with pain throughout life, untill the host become nothing but ashes (for fire elemental attribute) - in this sense it's like the madness in our world, if we don't learn to control it, we are controlled by it. Very very very few people (maybe only at most 3) are noted for being able to control magic - but there are a dozen (at least 12) super evil people who are completely possessed by magic, and countless many die from it. As a key design insight: all types of magic were once observable in an ancient time (like 500,000 years ago) - as can be seen on 壁画 of homonids. However, as some magic are used less and less, its presence decreases as evolution continues (especially since people cannot control it) - magic in this sense can be treated as &quot;inefficiencies&quot; of evolution: it used to be useful at a time in our evolutionary history, but later become less useful so we are ditching it from our genes. That's why the extra fire attribute and coldness attribute are generally favorable over other magical attribetus - actually more than half of the Ereb (以拉伯) people are affine to fire attribute and half of the Arphyria people are affine to coldness attribute because of their respective climates; On the other hand, the magical attribute of corruption is generally considered a tumor-like thing that's a result of corrupted genetics. <!--(Remark, Element) We will very likely need to introduce the machanism of channeling of energy remotely, e.g. for "growth" magical attribute to be a thing at all.--> For magic to work, two principles must be observed: conservation of energy and conservation of mass - naturally, using magic is highly dangerous and highly energy-consuming. At any scale, it's generally impossible to do ANYTHING USEFUL with magic before the modern era. During modern times, diplomacy flourishes, and there are more schools than ever studying this phenomena - teaching people to accept instead of resist (like learn to walk and run and have sex) - learn to use them in small places like generating warmth during winter time, or being able to resist coldness and do research in the arctics. When nano-magic was invented, the landscape of magic control and use is totally changed, and the scaling up follows a Moore's Law: every 5 years the total controllable mass in a single casting doubles - from the original human-controlled handful size of energy/mass, to later towering mountains of mass and energy. In year 4500, with the invention of <strong>matomic (-&gt;natiliar) weapon</strong>, capable of generating nuclear-power scale magic, the landscape of war is changed permanantly - and year 4200-4500 was filled with war - but afterwards, the cost of war is higher than ever before (with the potential of total destruction of man kind) and internationalization gets everyone to cease the fire. Nowadays (post-4500), the research in matomic technology is focused on construction and other civil-related projects and military defence <!--(TODO, development) Depict and imagine a war that is a mix between modern weapons and magical powers, balanced by relevant technological development and mass-energy equality.-->. Magical species: As genetics and natural selection goes, I think by giving indviduals the mutation to have specific natiliar powers, it will eventually create different species (like differentiation in homonids) - think of it like permanant difference in skin color: those possessing a firy attribute has slightly more coarse (and their culture also like to carve it) and slightly reddish skin (can be hot to touch, though it may be controllable), and those possessing a coldness attribute possesses a slightly bluish (almost transparent-like, but showing a bit blood vessels) white smooth skin with a bit more thin soft hair (like European girls), and those being tormented by &quot;Corruption&quot; have dark dry skin and accented 血管; wind is blueish, metal is goldenish and growth is greenish - though those are very subtle colors and won't change skins fundamentally unless otherwise stated. Throughout human history through inter-breeding, lots of such original genetic traits are surrepssed and become less proimnant - except at regions where development and trading is less open. <em>Those traits will give practical biological advantages that's directly bound to survival</em> (but by all means, they do not supercede the role of modern technology; Much like differences in species in D&amp;D/LOTR fantasies, without their magical aspects). In this case, we have many different variations in human species: those of magical attributes, those of white/dark/brown skin (高地人 etc.), and those of homo sapiens and homo erectus and Homo Cavernas (Neanderthals) - those three catagories might be diffused into the former two large groups. (Remark, #20220110) This is all cool and gives an original flavour of the world - however, especially the later part on global internationalization - it makes it a bit weirdly similar to our (real modern) world, creating a duplex that sort of matches each other but doesn't really. That is, if one considered Simulatione JUST AS OUR world with minimal changes, then we don't expect magic, but if we condier Simulatione a world where magic makes total sense, we sort of don't expect it to look like our world at all. But maybe this just takes some mental adjustments - what's more, one thing we know for certain, the Simulatione doesn't have supreme beings like God like humans, so it's still largely physical - we are just extending the availability of magic from nano-energy to an earlier time as some sort of natural phenomena observable even on human bodies.</li>
<li>(Magic, Technology) It might be possible to perform accelerated plantery growth through technological means.</li>
<li>(Magic, Technology) It might be possible to erase people's memory (especially restricted to a time-span that during a recent lassed time up until now) through technological means - though this must be clinical and targeted to single individuals (unlike Spiderman No Way Home)</li>
<li>(Magic, Technology) It might be possible to implant new and real memory (like Total Recall 2012) through chemical means - do notice there is generally no way to accelerate the intake efficiency much further so the subject will literally sit there to &quot;experience through&quot; while the memory is taking effect. Also the process might be a bit more complicated than simply injecting chemicals - manifestation of physical sounds and images and intake of certain drugs might be necessary.</li>
<li>(Magic, Technology, Medicine) 祝西城 has methods to revive a dead person (even regenerating a dead body) through medicine means.</li>
<li>(Magic, Design, Idea) If we want magic, then we can say region near Tellus is restricted of magic use because it's reserved research domain - outside the Sol system things can go wild as long as it doesn't bend gravity too much: it's an RPG game outside.
<ul>
<li>(Comment, Question, #20220502) Wait, if we have magic, can we directly build NFC floating in air with those fancy magical shields? What's the boundary?</li>
<li>(Model, Proposal) No, we live in a game, we are just like NPCs, and their game is Pay-to-Win. Those people with or without abilities out there are game masters or cash players, and researchers - people of all kind. The universe is a wild place. And life is abundant. Let there be at least 50,000 playable sections/maps/locations with abundant resources and relics and civilizations. Now we just need to explain why Earth is so uniquely &quot;boring&quot; - why haven't Tellurians see magic already?!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Measurement) Every magic or magical effect either or both continuously draws energy or instantaneously. To successfully release a magic, one thus must posses the amount of energy required for the duration of the magic or is capable to regenerate such weldable energy quick. Thus there are four parameters governing this process: 1) The current energy amount, 2) The cap energy capacity of the host, 3) The current weldable energy conversion rate. 4) The max weldable energy conversion rate (e.g. under turbo or hyperactivation).</li>

<li>(Scheme, Nano Magic) Three-person operated (usually 2 males 1 female) nano paint magic: requires an electro stasis field, and the others can remotely adjust parameters - one is responsible for painting, two are responsible respectively for adjusting material/flow and adjusting program. Once the skeleton is done in space, it can forge instantly into matter. It's a highly manual process and the operators must recite the structures in mind due to limited time. The automatic construction robots in the future might be able to do this automatically for non-circumstancial operations.</li>

<p>(#20230401) &quot;The imaginary realms are big and infinite.&quot; So as a core single magical features (which also binds together the idea of dreams and Canonical together), the PortKey is a free space where generations of Medalians have created worlds there. But you cannot take anything out. In fact, it might be a basic training for any school children to be able to imagine (called meditate) in Portkey. (idea from) D&amp;D and alike creates many imaginary realms.
(Story) When Hong showed Xiao Kan there, the lesson is to be able to imagine, and to enjoy. And PortKey represent the infinite possible enjoyment that one does in the imaginary realm, and focus on other more constructive things in the real world. One can spend forever inside Portkey, but life isn't going anywhere. When an individual enters Portkey, outside simulation is paused.</p>

<p>(#Dream Inspired, #20230812) 上古蛇頭這些靈獸在純玄幻中make sense，在客科幻中就不make sense。這些靈獸是可以飛的。
夢中彭道宏跟我說，可以先有先知，失去一點人性；然後就是修道者，已經接近真正的修真者。然後就是修真者，這些已經是改裝過的“超人”了，可以具有修行的能力。換言之，舊的客觀前的理論系統只能受神的blessing，並不能夠像神一樣存在，改造人則可以——這是Tellus（近似Cyberpunk）改造人的一個獨特的方向。也可以是另一個星球的文明方向。
(Archetype) 類似鋼鐵俠，不過不是通過外衣，而是本體。</p>

<ul>
<li>(CLue/Strategy) The Daily Life of the Immortal King. Art style is shit and actually too much like Japanese - all characters and style figures are like borrowed directly from some Japanes anime. But the plot is simplistic and the systems are very rudimentary but gives people lots of room for experimentation/contemplation and inspiration - e.g. that reminds me of how our original 剑坊系统 attempts to explain and system-fy fantasy novels: 缥缈之旅，西游记，诛仙。</li>
