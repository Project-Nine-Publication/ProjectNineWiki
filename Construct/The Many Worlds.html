        <p>(Inpsired by the officialization of the idea regarding Dreams and magic in P9 world; Originally an independent RPG game-oriented 剑坊 design)</p>
<p>The Many Worlds is a device or technology, or a simulator, that provides simulation for studying the power of one's subconsciousness. It's based on the ancient artifact/device &quot;穹庐&quot; from ancient eastern mythology concerning the creation of worlds by people with great poewr. The function of the device is that it effectively opens a realm where effects of our subconscious are measured and augmented 100-10000 times compared to the outside world, allowing one to practice and fine-tune his subconsciouss power. Conceptually or mechanically speaking, The Many Worlds must be created/used together with Skydome AND Hyupeda, and it not powered by only either of the two. For the former provides space, while the latter provides energy. Philosophically/Conceptually, each universe contains two most notable attributes among others: extension and intellect, where intellect is generalized as the concept of self-organization-capability. Skydome provides extension, while Hyupeda provides power, and the structural part of The Many Worlds is the construct programmed in. The &quot;super powers&quot; one learnt within THe Many WOrlds is not usable directly within the real world. On the other hand, as an implementation of MMORPG, The Many World is a game format that's widely adopted and used and played across many NFC identities, including dedicated game shops, and some 商家 allowing both exchange of virtual goods and identifying consumers with their TMW avatars - all those commercializing effort is handled by a Travellers of Worlds Company, which is (not surprisingly) funded by a large investment firm (Citadel of) Capital Investments (CCI), which is founded originally by Mr. Leng and Tao Ye.
When considering aspects pertaining to the magical nature of worlds, training in The Many Worlds should have some kind of special effect in strengthening certain aspects of the magical powers of capable individuals.</p>
<ul>
<li>(The Many World, Idea, #Implementation, #20220217) The Many World is NOT a real world. Aka. not a world inside Portkey. TMW can be an artificial non-mechanical simulation - a mental experiment actually, done by Charles and a group of others. TMW is <strong>a story world</strong>, where a large number of hired individuals are making up stories, following a program, and can be debugged and changed when needed. It's an improv play with a framework; It's D&amp;D happening on a massive parallel scale. The idea is that is Fepulans simulated our world, then can we &quot;simulate&quot; a world of our own with biological machines and random numbers (instead of digital or mechanical machines) - in fact, there might not be a way to tell the difference is a rigorous framework and procedure is followed when progressing this story-telling world. This particular implementation is a symbolization of the storytelling nature of P9, and it's a representation of how P9 (unlike other one-shot novels) is <strong>structured</strong> (like D&amp;D), and thus predictable yet with imaginative freedom: lots of things are left empy, with only general directions given, unless otherwise specific.</li>
<li>(Comment, #20230824) Per our latest conception, The Many Worlds is a simulation space constructed inside/with the help of Skydome and Hyupeda. That provides the physical reality for it, the rest of the contents of it generally matches what we would expect. Depending on how we are going to implement it, The Many Worlds could be the largest open-ended multi-MMORPG game there is in NFC, and lots of city booths are built just for playing this game.</li>
<li>(Comment, #20230827) Before we think about the significance and relation of The Many Worlds to the Canonical, we should consider the concept of The Many Worlds in its own regard, as it is. In other words, it's a physical reality in the Project Nine universe - and while telling stories, we MAY OR MAY NOT need to mention it in a specific Canonical while making literature choices. On the other hand, we can always (and probably should) write a dedicated novel for it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="names-and-etymology">Names and Etymology</h2>
<p>Throughout history and throughout countries and regions, there are many similar kinds of techniques and names referring to such devices that allows one to greatly amplify its mental power. However, here we are specifically referring to the three artifacts that humans ever created:</p>
<ol>
<li>天圆地方，穹庐</li>
<li>The Many Worlds by Mr. Leng, 十方世界：遍虚空界</li>
<li>The Portkey</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="section">剑坊</h3>
<p>(BELOW IS AN ATTEMPTIVE VERY EARLY DRAFT; IN GENERAL, THE KEY IDEA IS THAT THE 炼器 SYSTEM WORKS LIKE CIRCUITS ON A SCALE FASTER THAN SPEED OF LIGHT AND THUS REQUIRES CLOSED FORM SOLUTIONS AND CANNOT BE SOLVED USING ITERATIVE METHODS)</p>
<p>Fundamental principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's not possible to generate MORE output energy (power) than input energy (power); More interesting types of devices specialize in certain output characteristics instead of just magnify energy levels. E.g. it's possible to output high frequency while keeping same energy power level.</li>
</ol>
<p>Various energy components are ultimately energized through those mechanical means: pressure, light, electrical power (current and voltage), gravitational pull, temperature and chemical means.</p>
<p>(Energy) Energy &amp; Mass &amp; Speed of Light: <span class="math">\(E = m⋅c^2\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(c\)</span> has unit <span class="math">\(m/s\)</span> and m has unit <span class="math">\(kg\)</span>.</p>
<p>(Energy) Energy and Gravitational Propulsion: <span class="math">\(g = \frac{e⋅c^2}{kR⋅E}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is anti-gravitational acceleration with unit <span class="math">\(m/s^2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(e\)</span> is anti-gravitational field strength with unit $$, c is speed of light, k is gravitational pull strength (a parametric factor), R is field distance, and E is total energy.</p>
<p>(Mechanics) Force &amp; Mass &amp; Acceleration: <span class="math">\(F = m * a\)</span> where F has unit <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, m has unit <span class="math">\(kg\)</span>, and a has unit <span class="math">\(m/s^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>(Electricity) (Vibrating) Voltage &amp; Impedance and Electrical Current: (Complex) <span class="math">\(V = RI\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(V\)</span> has unit <span class="math">\(V\)</span>, <span class="math">\(R\)</span> has unit <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> and <span class="math">\(I\)</span> has unit <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>(Electricity) Voltage &amp; Electrical Charge: <span class="math">\(V = \frac{Q}{4πε_0r}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> is electrical charge with unit <span class="math">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>(Electricity) Voltage &amp; New Force Potential: <span class="math">\(F_0 = k⋅V\)</span>, where V has unit voltage <span class="math">\(V\)</span> (<span class="math">\(\frac{kg⋅m^2}{s^3⋅A}\)</span>), and <span class="math">\(F_0\)</span> has unit newton per meter squared <span class="math">\(N/m^2\)</span> (<span class="math">\(1 \frac{kg}{m⋅s^2}\)</span>).</p>
<h3 id="high-level-ancient-ambiguous-proposal">修行术语 (high level, ancient, ambiguous) Proposal</h3>
<p>(Unrecord, Dream Inspired) (P9, Terminology) 基本力量（源泉）：骨阔扁偏匀（区别于元婴、修真、气、阴阳、金木水火土） 。在这之上可是发展体术。除此之外力量类型还有：刚柔.
Aka. instead of naming out &quot;forces&quot; as elemental powers, we name them according to their characteristics. This gives a refreshing feeling.</p>
