<p>Being able to see the future is a premise of Hyupdeda and a natural consequence of physical permeability of time travel. Notice there is a big difference between seeing the future and &quot;predicting&quot; the future in the sense of 演算 consequences and gaining strategical information. Both Medalian Hyupeda and Xiramus can see the future but only the Hyupeda has the capacity to actually &quot;predict&quot; and in a sense &quot;query&quot; the future. Xiramus can directly see what's going to happen in the future on things that are directly relevant or presented to them, but they cannot ask questions or inquiry further about the ins-and-outs of events. On the other hand, the future that Xiramus see DO CHANGE when conditions change, while when Hyupeda tells something will happen, it is physically bound to happen - though the trick with Hyupeda is how you ask the exact question.</p>
<p>Because Hyupedas are only available to Medalian queens, the tradition and teaching of using it is of particular interest and worth investigating.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Xiramu's prophecy services are more broadly available to wide variety of civilizations (including Krukians), but how to efficiently interpret and use the prophecies is an art and different leaders will use it differently. We will also explore this topic in the future.</p>
