<p>During the flourishing periods of Medalian-Tellurian cultural exchange, Medala started establish schools on Tellurian lands, the first of many which established with (country name ???, this is the country that Vandentra belongs to) is in Vandentra. This style of school was lattered called Vandentra-Medala-Alternative School. It's also called Shwangchwan Education, named after the first headmaster of the original Vandentra-Medala-Alternative School established in (North York) (a district of Vandentra).</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<p>Original proto-name was &quot;Waldorf-Medala-Alternative School&quot; which combines the meanins of Waldorf education (a holistic approach), Medalian origin and alternative school type (as a substitute to ordinary primary and secondary education). The word &quot;Waldorf&quot; in &quot;Waldorf education&quot; refers to the Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory in Stuttgart, Germany. The first school based on this educational philosophy was established in 1919 for the children of the workers of the Waldorf-Astoria factory. The name &quot;Waldorf&quot; has since become associated with this particular educational approach. For that reason, since Waldorf is a location, we will use the name of the location for the first appearance of this school.</p>
<p>The proto-origin for first appearance of this school is &quot;Toronto&quot;, which in the world of nowadays Tellus is Vandentra. A shorter form of this education is named after the first headmaster.</p>
