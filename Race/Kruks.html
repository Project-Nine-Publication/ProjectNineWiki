<blockquote>
<p>I have special affection/attachment to Kruks because they are exploration into the very being of life: forms, formats, altitudes, and styles.</p>

<p>Three thousand years after Queen I.
Kruks have very fast evolvement.</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kruks: Original name.</li>
<li>Kruks: Somewhat colloquial/vulgar term referring to ???.</li>
<li>(PENDING): 这才是他们的自称和种族称呼。语言是Krukian（没错，还是这个说法），含义是“宏大宇宙庇佑的-&gt;无所牵绊依赖的/完全自由的(Freeman)”。</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section">势力范围</h2>
<p>(PENDING DESCRIPTION OF FACTIONS AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS)</p>
<h2 id="krukian-religion">Krukian Religion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It's only natural for the intellect to admire and worship those that surpasses it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PENDING.</p>
<p>The Tellurian religion is building a concrete physical neuron construct - it's the magical process of forming what's called &quot;???&quot; (like 舍利) at some central regoin of the artificial brain. It's a highly condensed state of artificial neuron construction and contains a singularity of intelligence/information. It's completely isolated from the rest of the brain (when done right) and there are many magical use of this particular construct....
That ??? (considered as a consumable) alone contains an (entrance to) entire universe (can you think of something smaller and cooler and more magical? E.g. some kind of mending power to all matters when applied directly). Collecting many and put them together, that opens a path. It's discovered after Gilbrith, by the great religious leader Sabrith.</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>Kruks possess the technology of hybrid artificial general super intelligence.</p>
<p>Kruks have gravitational technology that can make artificial gravity but NOT anti-gravity (which stops them from hiding or going inside a black hole, and maybe also forbids them to control faster-than-light travel due to incomplete control).</p>
<p>They have <strong>Neutronium Bomb</strong> (per <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfXQeP6ESnE">this spec</a>) made with captured unstable neutrons inside anti-gravity stasis field device <strong>Zadina</strong>.</p>
<p>Krukians CANNOT perform long-distance faster-than-light intergalactic travel on their own despite their super fast mass production rate and artificial super intelligence - somethings are not discovered or solved by intelligence or computing power alone.</p>
