        <p>Tags: Existence, Fepulans World, Race</p>
<p>The documented (per Medalian culture) creator of our universe. Concrete contact has been made, and their presence is generally known in the outer wilder space.
Their height as measured in their own world is around 5 meters (adult height from 4.2 to 6.8 meters).</p>
<p>Fepulans population: 10% has nothing to do and just plays games (it's culture now), 50% are scientists and sharing knowledge is difficult because there are too many, 40% are social workers, medics, government officials (though overall population is largely self-organized), engineers and fundamental workers.</p>
<p>Living in an almost-dead universe, everything everywhere is dark and speeding away from each other, and it's a twisted space-dimension. The Fepulans live on the edge of a supermassive blackhole and power their civilization through the energy extracted from it. Supermassive black holes could be the only power source left when stars died out - they emit next to no energy. Such energy will last almost forever, and they used this energy to create a simulated universe. (Even if the low energy emitted by supermassive black holes would require the universes to run at a millionth of real speed, there would be enough time to run trillions of simulated universes all the way to the death of stars. Who knows, we might be living in such a simulated universe.)</p>
