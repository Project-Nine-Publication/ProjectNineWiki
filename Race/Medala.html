        <p>(This entry is about the Medalian Civilization, for Medalian people - racial/biological related information, see &quot;Medalian People&quot;)
(PENDING MIGRATING RACE DETAIL INFORMATION TO MEDALIAN PEOPLE ENTRY)</p>
<p>Name: Medala, 美达拉，美达拉文明，美达拉人，美达拉文明簇</p>
<p>The word &quot;Medala&quot; is an umbrella term that refers to a range of species and meta-species from the Medalian cultural complex. The home for the Medalian people are the planets within a distant galaxy in the Doma (planetary) system. The origin of their development is on a planet called Ids - realm of Gods.
The Medalian species along the development of their galactical civilization have complex evolvements and history. The most ancient lineage is called &quot;Moah&quot;, and The Medalian Civilization Group includes three major types: Moah, Kruks, and Xiramu. Ever since the explosion of information technology, genetic engineering and artificial intelligence, the Medalian species have evolved from the most basic biological forms to something that we call &quot;meta-humans&quot;, meaning their bodies are no longer (entirely) biological.</p>
<p>Among the identity of Moah, there are many dozens of different (cultural and biological) races, cultures, and nations, spread across a few planets. Usually &quot;Medala&quot; is the unmrella term that refers to the Moah Civilization. Notice that almost all animals on Ids are hyper-intelligent to the extent that they are &quot;magical&quot;, and there are two significant properties of megalian biology: 1) Intelligent beings (including animals) can perceive and see Medalians, 2) Younger Medalian childs possess hyper-perceptivity that allows them to communicate with hyper-beings.</p>
<p>See race specific note for detailed description of the specific race. This entry focuses on high level civilization as a hole. Notice in practice, the word &quot;Medala/Medalian&quot; may refer to &quot;Moah&quot; due to their dominance as the identity.</p>
<p>It's Medalians' greated hope to come home; Home is very far but with PortKey they realized everything - they understand why their current planet is so barre, and they miss home.</p>
<p>Medala possess extraordinary gene engineering thanks to its embryo modification technologies. Medalian peoples are extremely adaptive and highly flexibible.</p>

<h2 id="the-medalian-people-new-archetype-20230408">The Medalian People - New Archetype (20230408)</h2>
<p>IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER MEDALIANS ARE HUMAN/HUMANOID/HOMINION-LIKE OR COMPLETELY ALIEN LIFEFORM - THEY MUST BE A RESULT OF EVOLUTION. THIS KIND OF EVOLUTIONARY LINEAGE IS WHAT GIVES MEDALIANS DEEP CULTURAL AND HUMAN-LIKE EMPATHY, AN APPRECIATION TO BEAUTY AND CULTURE, ETC. IT WOULD HOWEVER BE VERY NICE IF THEY ARE CARBON OR SILICONE BASED, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN😉 (AKA. FUCKABLE). IT IS ALSO BEST THAT THEY ARE BIPEDAL OR HAVE SOME SORT OF ERECT BODY SHAPE.</p>
<!-- (Record, #20230408) Proposed 20230408: Let Medalians be true aliens - they have their own unique look and is nothing like humans/Tellurians. Some kind of greenish, crystal and transparent structure sounds cool. THIS IS NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL (DREAM) IMPRESSION. And it's good, it's original, it's bold, and it's new. Now, you just need to imagine Tao Ye developing affection for a crystal-like alien (and imagine how or what this emotion is😂). See dated item 20230406 for original proposal. -->
<!-- (Remark, #20230409) Isn't it weird that all bipedal animals have four limbs? -->
<p>They are aliens and LOOKS nothing like humans. However, they do have languages (and we should try our best to make it NOT sound like human languages - or even do not have human like sounds at all) - it's through languages that we can learn and know each other. Also, they have culture, personality and qualities etc. just like us - that's how mutual affections can rise.</p>
<p>Issue: If an alien species is bipedal, then like humans, their bodies would be organized around a vertical axis, meaning that they would have a head at the top, a trunk in the middle, and limbs extending downward. If they have similar kind of biology (even with a different biological base element), similar kind of evolutional history, simular kind of political history, then they kind of must sort of look like us in large ways - at least they are like those alien species as depicted in Star Wars. So it means our likely available room of modification is limited to not their overall bipedal shape, but variances in specific body parts. Among those, important factors to consider: environmental factors of Ids, gravity level of Ids, spine, pelvis, and limb bones positions and other configurations of bones, potential external appendages such as wings or tails. That is, the most likely areas we can vary is in terms of anatomy, albeit based largely on human anatomy.</p>
<h3 id="biology">Biology</h3>
<p>(#Magical, #Legend, biology) Women are born with godly powers, men are super intelligent/logical. (idea from) Such inequalities etc. shows women and men really live in different worlds for us humans. <!--(Remark, #20230401) Pending further elaborate and combine with the discussion on Magic.--></p>
<h2 id="medalian-power">Medalian Power</h2>
<p>As the power structure goes, the Medalian empire is necessarily a <strong>constitutional monarchy</strong>; As the nature of things goes and due to the spread of the civilization, it's much more complicated than that.</p>
<!-- The ancient ancestor of Medalisn are NOT humans. The humans are untouched on Tellus. But Medalians has its own story just like the relationship between Neanderthals and homo sapiens with their own distinct ancestor before they were pulled into the Central Stage of the Universe. -->
<p>As history goes, since it was happening at such an early time, without text records - <em>for a very long time the Medalian descendants of the (Neanderthals) forgot (or might not even have realized) where they are from</em>. It's only from the amber beacon signal from the Portkey they become curious about this system that's so far away from what seems to be the <em>more populated region of the universe</em> - there lies the power of their origin <!--I wonder does Queen actually know all of those - or even her is hidden from such historical knowledge, or hidden from the true knowledge of the Portkey, about Fepulans.-->.</p>
<h2 id="key-ideas">Key Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Medalians (Moah) have anti-gravity technology, which is exclusive among other species. <!--(Remark, #20230401) A lot of civilizations seem to have technologies that looks like they either make use of or "defies" gravity: humans have March Engine, Kruks/Aboriginal Medalians have graviton shields, while Medala (non-Krukian)'s "anti-gravity" is really as the word suggests: they directly bend/reverse gravity and have the capacity to morph spacetime. The extreme of this is Xiramu.--></p>
</li>
<li><p>(202205) Miah is not the one invading earth, Moah never torqured humans - but they did has a bad relationship one time after humans realized they brought Kruks here. Miah is falling and The Dark Kind taking over gradually, Queen and Kirin must leave earth. On their way toward the sky, the spaceship was shot down (reasonably), and this is what happened next: &quot;They spent 3 days searching the ship wreck untill they went out with what seemed like a rectangular shaped object covered in cloth. He thought that must be the coffin of the queen (which is wrong, it's the Portkey). Then they built a giant burner, bursting colorful frames. And the fire kept on for 2 months until the site has nothing left - the whole ship has been disintegrated.&quot; (How much pollution will that cause to the air?) In short, The Dark Kind won't let Queen leave because they want get hold of the Portkey (notice the portkey can be used by the Dark Kind, at least the interface part, even if they cannot enter the inner world - by all means, The Dark Kind might desparately want to disset this object in order to study its composition).</p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>Exclusive Technology: Medalians have anti-gravity technology.</p>
<h2 id="military">Military</h2>
<p>(As per military armour style goes) Females are in general not strong than males - so even though female armours exist, per most natural specialization, Female soldiers are trained on ehthletics rather than strength, and they <em>wear very very light protection</em> to make sure their actions are optimized in speed. In other cases, females are usually in the command role. <!--(idea from) Why historically there ain't female armours like fantasy female armours - because women don't go to the battle field.--></p>

<li>Why do Medalians Looks like Humans? Answer: (#20230406) This is a constantly asked and frequently brought up question. In short, the answer is: they only look so in the minds of those who wish to perceive them as such. (#20230408) No, they don't.</li>
