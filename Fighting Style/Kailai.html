<p>Kailai /Kælayi/: Named after the controller. We need better name for this fighting style itself.</p>

<p>(As witnessed from a local combat village training) Armour Conbat Units
By using Reckon energy, we can utilize sense of smell and geolocation to greatly enhance a soldier's operational range. Wind knives (a kind of shoes) allows great-distance Teleportational jump (around 3 levels high, or 9 meters) while fighting, and by using a special standace (匍匐) and holding on to foot a soldier can 在空中滑行。A single operator will usually be responsible for outlook the battle field (range is 200-500 m radius while directing and placing geo marks. The special spatial bomb eliminates entities within a spherical range silently and efficiently. This kind of combat is highly mobile and efficient (and has a lot of jumping around). In the dream, and as is deployed in reality, those training units are from special purpise villages, which are usually from mountains. A single Kailai (female leader) will operate in a Fushi (Blue spherical shell structure) control console. Soldiers will use attachments on their: ears, nose, mouse, forehead, and bottom of feet. Those attachments are easily installed and removed, and allows efficient communication. The great mobility and close-combat precision makes such land combat units lethal and much more agile compared to Tellurian 射击兵团. A troop of 3 Wakajuns (this kind of land unit soldier) plus a single Kailai can eliminate a group of 25-50 armoured soldiers in combat formation in less than 15 seconds.</p>
<h2 id="style">Style</h2>
<p>May be originating just from a very particular country/village, instead of being some uniformly trained fighting styles. In that case we need to consider what makes that village unique. On the other hand, if this is a very broadly used 兵种, then the training for such can be more wide-spread across the Medalian empire.</p>
