<p>Dreams (in the P9 world) are a bridge to THE alternative reality. In P9, people's dreams are consistent in a sense that the things they interact with ARE a reality that exists in the Dream Realm or the Astral Plane. They are however, highly individualized BUT can be connected with some internal or external help. (The original motivation for this is for people to be able to take things out from their dreams.)</p>
<p>This is manefested in the following asepcts:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's a bridge that allows one to temperarily wonder into the realm of the dead, and see and interact with the deceased.</li>
<li>It's controllable to a much higher and generally achievable degree and scale (aka. much more accessible to the general public). This is a exaggeration compared to the real world.</li>
<li>It's well-known. Everyone experience it in their life a lot (including lucid dreams). This is a exaggeration compared to the real world.</li>
<li>It's directly relavent to the real world, with NO confusion whatsoever - people's dreams are either trapped in the real world or completely wild, and there is little confusion.</li>
<li>With proper training, it's possible to directly affect the real world (more like other forms of explicit magics) - however it functions at a much deeper level. The Many Worlds is an enhanced environment that greatly enhances this effect.</li>
</ol>
<p>A main theoratical framework for constructing such a realm can be typical understanding of Atral Projection and the astral plane. A practical and mythodological development of this is the traditional 妖鬼神 framework as established by 聊斋、西游、红楼 etc. Apparently, some kind of religion should be developed dedicated to this subject (e.g. Somnium/Oneirosophy).</p>
