<p>Garden Housing Complex (GHC) is one of Tao Ye's original architecture schemes.</p>
<p>Key Principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Single/Compound-tall building;</li>
<li>Complex/multi-functional building, garden-style, self-contained;</li>
<li>All Charles style houses (except intentionally designed so) will NOT be saving on effort and material cost.</li>
<li>Stairs can cost A LOT (carpets or granite material); 楼梯间 can be very fancy</li>
</ol>

Consideration: 1) Less privacy; 2) Potential health hazard from high-fall.</p>
<h2 id="template-1-open-community-style-semi-enclosed-courtyard">Template 1 - 四合天庭(中庭) Open-Community Style Semi-Enclosed Courtyard</h2>
<p>Style defining elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The building is generally 4-sided, however 6-sided can be more aesthetically pleasing.</li>
<li>Building isusually from 8 to 45 floors high; Area ranging from 60mx60m to 110mx110m and more; Indoor side width to courtyard open space width ratio from 1:1 to 0.3:1.</li>
<li>Every floor has two sides of corridles - a private one on the outside, and a public one on the inside. Some can be reverse.</li>
<li>There is large, open staircase connection every floor.</li>
<li>Every side of the building has at least 1 elevator.</li>
<li>For higher buildings it might be necessary to have floors reserved for water reserve (for water pressure).</li>
<li>The center can be either a pond, a large swimming pool, a large open market, or a 2-12 floor tall structure (e.g. for warehouse, or a central reception building).</li>
<li>The top can be covered with glass for rain protection or completely open (generally not recommended).</li>
<li>The bottom floor of the building is usually access controlled and fully-enclosed, however this can be done with a lot of free-accessible space.</li>
<li>The outside of the bottom floor is usually garden-style, with 花圃 and pavements and seats.</li>
<li>Shops and markets and offices are generally in the lower floor, but generally available every 5 floors - unit types on each floor can also be mixed. If sound isolation can be done perfectly we can even have gyms and swimming pools in the middle floors.</li>
<li>Gardens or at even small farms might be present in the middle floors.</li>
<li>Can be full interior and atmosphere controlled by having full enclosure.</li>
<li>All floors is by design floor-tolerant up to 5cm - this design also allows washing floors by pumping water directly, especial staircases in non-fully-enclosed buildings (since it's not practical even for full enclosure buildings to have carpets on all stairs - or we just need to spend a lot money).</li>
