        <p>An easy-to-learn artificial language introduced by the seventh Medalian Queen - Ora Sham Dζlinm - during the <strong>4th Great Unification</strong>. The words/speech are phonetic (sound-based), while the scripts/writing system is <strong>semantical</strong> (based on parts).</p>
<p>The language have deep history but the final form is mostly artificial to be fair for all participants while borrowing some elements from wide variety of languages. We should consider the Medalian Language proper as a single language without much dialects due to high standardilization. However, generally speaking, the word &quot;medalian languages&quot; is an umbrella term that refers to wide range of languages that the Medalian (Medala) people cross the universe speaks (may even include Krukian languages depending on whether people consider Krukians as part of Medalian Civilization).</p>
<ol>
<li>Common Medalian (): The standardized Medalian language, aka. Medalian Proper.</li>
<li>Konralikan: Historical descending language from Konralika.</li>
<li>...</li>

<p>Medalian Language (Design) Tests: Here are the various tests conducted by the Language Design Committee when coming up with the new Medalian Language (the current language): Shouting test (must be audible, must be easy to make louder sounds), Speed reading test, Prettiness test (must sound good). Here are further tests for the scripts: Recognizable in a distance, font/typeface tolerant, distinct and meaningful (thus graphic), limited strokes (quick writing).</p>
