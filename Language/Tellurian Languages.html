            <p>(New: According to Tellurian Mythology Systems, when Gods created Tellurians in three batches, they taught them three different languages for initial communication purposes, and a thread of ancient and holy languages are descedants from them; One of them is still spoken by large. The rest of Tellurian languages are semi-native developed)</p>
<p>Tellus is a completely fictional planet in a completely fictional G-bound planetary system with two suns in a completely fictional universe; As such, its people are completely fictional and <strong>speak completely fictional languages</strong>. To avoid confusion with Earth languages, we must do the following:</p>
<p>(THIS SECTION LOOKS LIKE IT BELONGS TO SOME DATED ENTRY RATHER THAN INSIDE WIKI)</p>
<ol>
<li>All Tellurian languages have their own names, potentially translated in different languages; Each language, however, has a &quot;base&quot; language that corresponds to a modern/ancient Earth language;</li>
<li>When mention in text or in novel, we never ever directly talk about specific phrases of languages or literary work - we use various literary devices to work around the need of showing &quot;exactly&quot; the source language; Names will be pronounciation based 音译 into the narrative language of the novel or corresponding in-world contexts.</li>
<li>When use in visual productions, we will use exact words from the corresponding model language, but use different letters or glyphs - the glyphs shall however be derived from the same sort of word creation concepts, sharing the same encoding but appear differently. This is essentially a distinct font. Notice this has direct and immediate impact when it comes to designing our English-language name based logos (e.g. Eleven Baker in Alphabetica would not be written as &quot;E&quot; or &quot;B&quot; letter in standard English font);</li>
<li>When used in audio productions, the characters will just be speaking the underlying model language, but always use the corresponding transcribed fonts when written down.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will create a complete table of all language mappings (likely will need to involve some graphical tools/formats) when we talk about specific languages. At the moment, the more urgent and easier one to deal with is we need an alternative alphabet for English/Alphabetica. The key idea to remember is that we will want to keep the same encodings and letters.</p>
<p>We said Tellurian doesn’t use Earth scripts - that’s non-sense. Some Tellurian languages are EXACT scripts as Earthlings use - since the invention and existence of Earth language scripts can be treated non-specific (?). However, we definitely want to break the demographics of the usage of such scripts then in this case - e.g. especially should make sure multiple countries of different cultural identities use the same script. (Idea from) “佛“字在Tellurian里面怎么写——就跟中文一样就好；之所以这么说是因为想要Jerry Sun说的那个“佛指引道路”的解字故事，但其实这并不重要。 (Comment, #20230922) No, as mentioned above, ALL GLYPHS WILL BE REINVENTED. We don't need to keep very specific &quot;stories&quot; behind the specific letters - though we can certainly borrow certain letters if we want, e.g. I think the letter &quot;九&quot; (and all Chinese numbers) are pretty good on their own. For the case of &quot;佛&quot;, we will first derive a version of 人字旁，then the 弗 part, then just combine the two - that's the key &quot;idea&quot; behind the original word: 佛 - it borrows the sound, and added a &quot;person&quot; to it.</p>
<h2 id="literativeartistic-representation-of-the-languages">Literative/Artistic Representation of the Languages</h2>
<p>Tellurian languages will NOT be designed from ground up at all - on the contrary, we will design at least the main Medalian language along with several other variations for the Medalian world.</p>
<p>During our writings and graphical illustrations, there will often be the need to represent people speaking and using Tellurian languages, here is our approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>For all textual publications, the &quot;format language&quot; or the <strong>representation language</strong> should be considered just a trans(literation)lation of the actual language the whatever groups of people its referring to;</li>
<li>All Tellurian languages will be a derivation (with vocabulary modifications) to a corresponding Earth language, called <strong>proxy language</strong>; It will NOT be an authentic representation of that language - to make this super clear to the audience, we should NEVER give the false impression that the language that those people are saying are actually the corresponding proxy language;</li>
<li>For textual contexts, when two groups of the people speak different languages, especially when such languages are different from the current <strong>representation language</strong> (the language of the text that's being written), we can/should just use the <strong>writing system</strong> of the proxy language; As writing system goes, what we are borrowing from the proxy language are three specific things, and no more: 1) Alphabet or glyphs, 2) Basic language constructs (and some grammar); 3) Some vocabulary. To make it super clear the language is made up, or the proxy language is merely a representation and not the exact counterpart of earth languages, we just need to make it super super clear by simply introducing <strong>a large number of made-up words</strong>: and in order to do this properly, we just need to study the corresponding proxy language well enough we have a good feeling of its vocabulary systems and know how to make up new words.</li>
<li>For graphical illustrations, just pick the closest <strong>proxy language</strong> to use for representation purpose.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="one-final-remark-on-the-feelings-of-names-as-represented-in-different-representation-proxy-languages">One Final Remark on the Feelings of Names as Represented in Different Representation &amp; Proxy Languages</h2>
<p>Using the example of “萧衎” (中文表示，本源原理国，词源清纳语) and &quot;Kanit&quot; (英文表示，本源原理国清纳语翻译成阿尔法语，词源阿尔法语):</p>
<ol>
<li>The single fact about “萧衎” is its sound, which when represented using 汉语拼音 is like this: Xiao Kan; However for the purpose of the main literature language, we want to write it exactly as “萧衎”, but this is conceptually NOT how it would be represented in the fictional non-existent 清纳语, so we work backward to figure out what would it be (sounded like) in 清纳语 - turns out it's &quot;Thyken&quot; (when transliterated in our-world English). The bottom line: it's like there is a version of Hong Kong transliteration of Chinese last names to sound more like English words, and just as how the transliteration/romanization of Medalian words tend to look more like English vocabularies, this is exactly what's happening: the original name (when transliterated in English) &quot;Thyken&quot; is instead of being transliterated as &quot;赛肯&quot;, becoming &quot;萧衎&quot;.</li>
<li>As &quot;Kanit&quot; and its seemingly non-Chinese regions &quot;Takensian&quot; and &quot;???&quot; go - they ARE INDEED NON-CHINESE. However, we can somehow transliterate it into something that sounds like Chinese (much like how the movie &quot;Inception&quot; is <em>translated</em> as &quot;盗梦空间&quot;) - we can either: 1) Find suitable ways how things are often named to completely rename the name so it's localized and native, including studying the properties of the subject to figure out better and native ways to name it; 2) Simply pick, beased on experience with real words of the corresponding representation and proxy language, formulation of words that sounds native, without concerning much what it actually means. As such we have &quot;Kanit&quot; as &quot;原理国&quot; - do we know what it means? No idea. This is the second approach. On the other hand, &quot;西京&quot; (if the Tellus-native version is &quot;Sykin&quot;) would be the first approach.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-representation-language-of-novels-and-other-formal-p9-productions">The Representation Language of Novels and other Formal P9 Productions</h2>
<p>For the purpose of the novel, we will be written in just those three languages, in order of priority:</p>
<ol>
<li>Chinese,</li>
<li>English,</li>
<li>Japanese.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-five-major-languages">The Five Major Languages</h2>
<p>当地五大主导文明分别代表：</p>
<ol>
<li>阿尔法语<!--（英语, English alphabet）--></li>
<li>中原文/中部语<!--（大陆中部）; This will be a completely fictional language, likely with its own writing system--></li>
<li>希玻语<!--Hebrew/Arabic--></li>
<li>清纳语<!--中文, Chinese writing--></li>
<li>季度文/季度语 (Kapadis, from Kapada)<!--日语, Japanese writing, closely related to 清纳语--></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="other-proxy-languages">Other Proxy Languages</h2>
<p>Some other specific language (and in particular their writing systems) are interesting:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sanskrit (for sacred Buddhism writings)/Kharoshthi(卡罗须提文): 天城体（书写）/雅語/贝多罗叶语/贝叶经/天竺語/古佛语/古汉努达语/梵书/大梵文<!--避免跟地球上的梵语太接近，我们不翻译成“梵语”--><!--"梵"字来历：天神“梵天”所創--> (As the formal context of Sanskrit, its casual counterpart is called Prakrit in our world) <!--On Tellus and any word that talks about it, we should never use the word "Sanskrit" or "Prakrit" because it doesn't exist there.--></li>
<li>Hebrew/Arabic (just as a foreign language)</li>
<li>Espranto</li>
<li>Hindi</li>
</ol>
<p>Some languages we are not particularly interested so we won't use as proxy languages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Korean</li>
<li>Germany</li>
<li>French</li>
<li>Spanish</li>
</ol>
