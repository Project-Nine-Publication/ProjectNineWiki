* High-end Kruks entertainment
* being inside a VR shooter game for real is like a dream experience (per 20220202 drram unrecorded, or per Wasteland). 
* It's RPG, played for real: a background large city waste setting with all kinds of real and enterrable places, and throughout many many days, players play and survive to become fhe last survival. It's a shooter game and about combat of resources and Kruks can use their automation technologies (with certain limits) - more time in is thus more win. Some games will allow new players drop-in mid-game for some excitement and undetermined surprise attack. 
* There are amateur hobbyists and experiencd professionals play such games for the entertainment of audience - both ticket and actua participation is very high. 
* An entire distant planet is developed for this purpose by a Kruks entrepreneur. Only Kruks or Kruks based lifeforms can play this game and it's actually partly allowed (and hard to prohibit) to gather information from the outside (e.g. by watching TV somewhere else) when playing such games. Though signal is interfered. 
* In the game, (depending on session) there are places where it's friendly (especially if lots of players at the beginning) safe zones fornplayers replenish easily (not paid - still competed!) and live. Later players will have to go out and drvelop their own habitats. The battlefield is super cool and dynamic and each generation of players leave something unique on their own. 
* It's expensive because not all Kruks can easily afford and live in another body. It's one of the most popular TV/reality/game show across the Kruks world.
* Alternatively, others (mostly Medalian, maybe some aliens?) can join through remote brain control technology, with varying degress of r realism. Humans invented something similar after *Drone 2050* when they gained similar technology - though that is more like a professional sport (like F1), a test ground for new technology and super expensive that only leading companies can participate.-->
