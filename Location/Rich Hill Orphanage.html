<p>The name &quot;Astorbridge&quot; came from ChatGPT.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The <strong>Astorbridge family</strong>, known for their early 20th-century success in the regional steel industry, established the orphanage as a charitable endeavor during a period of rapid industrial growth. Founding matriarch <strong>Elizabeth Astorbridge</strong> believed strongly in community investment, setting aside a portion of her family’s land and wealth to support vulnerable children.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Years (1918–1950):</strong> Operated as the “Astorbridge Orphan Asylum,” housing up to 60 children in large dormitories. Strict routines were common, reflecting the institutional standards of the time.</li>
<li><strong>Mid-Century Reforms (1950–1980):</strong> Progressive child welfare policies led to the introduction of smaller living units, on-site education, and social work support. During this period, the orphanage’s name was changed to <strong>Astorbridge Children’s Home</strong> to highlight its shift toward a family-like environment.</li>
<li><strong>Modernization (1980–Present):</strong> A series of renovations added therapy spaces, modern dorm rooms, and updated recreational facilities. The Astorbridge Foundation continues to finance expansions, ensuring the Home remains a leader in child-focused residential care.</li>
