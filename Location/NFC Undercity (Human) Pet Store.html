<p>&quot;Second hand pets, they don't bind easily with others any more&quot;. (Idea from) Why I don't like those two cats at Jerry's. Maybe they are not like cats I used to have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This is P9 Original/九层楼原生 because it's from an earlier unorganized time where ideas are more spontanenous and random)
(We had a dedicated note on the original design of this concept, but so far as of 20230921 we haven't been able to find the original notes)</p>
<p>Funded by ??? (some Tellurian/Krukian) and operated by (some Tellurian and Krukian), this underground illegal store satisfies the need and fantasy of suppresed Medalians living underground of NFC. This is however a rather small-scale store, with just slightly over 3 rooms and a dozen goods under display/for sale - the same industry is much more robust in Doma system, where (while still being &quot;underground&quot; but not literally) large supermarket-size stores are open for shopping for Tellurian/Human/Krukian and all kinds of other alien species as pets, and with much more enforcements, food, and supply goods for sale (we will create a wiki entry for it when the idea gets more developed, the site is likely NOT on Ids but on some secondary planets in Doma or maybe some colonies on moons).</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<ul>
<li>We always called it 地下城宠物店 or 宠物商店, apparently a more interesting name with more interesting back story is needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="goods">Goods</h2>
<p>The goods available for sale in this location is a representation of the greater variety at sale in more developed pet stores (e.g. in Doma system):</p>
<ul>
<li>compound compressed solid high protein healthy food (like western dog/cat food). They are healthy, they are nutritious, it's just not so organic.</li>
</ul>
