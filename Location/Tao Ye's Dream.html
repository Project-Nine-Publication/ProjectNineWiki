            <p>(idea from) Isn't everything (fun emotional stuff) just better in dreams? Like sex etc. Safer, more practical. No consequences. So Tao Ye keep reality for hard work, and enjoy if needed in his dreams.</p>
<!-- This skit explores the lavish fantasy of ruling over a kingdom where desires are fulfilled instantly and adoration flows endlessly, with a lighthearted tone. -->
<p>Like the Kingdom of Eternal Bliss. A luxurious throne room, adorned with golden pillars and draped in silken fabrics of deep crimson and royal blue. The air is filled with the scent of jasmine and the soft melody of harps played by unseen musicians. At the center sits KING AZURION, a man in his early thirties, wearing a crown encrusted with sapphires and diamonds. Around him, 50 half-naked angels float gracefully, their ethereal wings shimmering in the sunlight streaming through the stained-glass windows.</p>
<p><strong>King Azurion:</strong> (leaning back on his throne, sipping from a goblet of celestial ambrosia) Ah, life is good. Who dares say a mortal cannot dream himself into divinity?</p>
<p><strong>Angel #1:</strong> (approaching with a golden platter of exotic fruits) My king, a slice of starfruit from the celestial orchards?</p>
<p><strong>King Azurion:</strong> (waving a hand dismissively) Later, my radiant muse. First, let us hear the poetry of the heavens. Angel Seraphina, recite something divine.</p>
<p><strong>Angel Seraphina:</strong> (floating closer with a voice as soft as the wind) &quot;In Azurion’s realm, where gold meets sky, / The stars bow low, the angels sigh. / No sorrow dwells, no time runs fast, / This kingdom’s joy shall forever last.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>King Azurion:</strong> (clapping softly) Marvelous! Truly, I am the king of kings. This is paradise, yet... (pausing dramatically) perhaps I need more entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>Angel #2:</strong> (hovering beside him with a silver lyre) Shall I summon the celestial choir, my lord? Or perhaps organize another feast in your honor?</p>
<p><strong>King Azurion:</strong> (grinning mischievously) Both! And after that, I shall lead the angels in a game of celestial chess. The stakes? One hour of uninterrupted flattery for the winner.</p>
<p><strong>Angel #3:</strong> (laughing softly) Your majesty, your brilliance knows no bounds.</p>
<p><strong>King Azurion:</strong> (sighing contentedly, addressing the room) How fortunate I am to rule over this eternal kingdom of bliss. A kingdom where my every whim is a command, my every desire met with reverence. Where the skies are forever golden, and the ground sparkles as if made of crushed diamonds.</p>
<p><strong>Angel #4:</strong> (offering a goblet of stardust wine) And where your subjects adore you with all their hearts, my king.</p>
<p><strong>King Azurion:</strong> Indeed! (raising the goblet) To my kingdom! May it never fade, and may I never wake from this glorious dream.</p>
<p><strong>All Angels:</strong> (in perfect harmony) To the king of Eternal Bliss!</p>
<p>Scene fades as the sound of laughter and celestial music echoes through the throne room. King Azurion leans back, his eyes closed, a smile on his lips, basking in the perfection of his imagined realm.</p>
