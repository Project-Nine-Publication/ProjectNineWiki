<p>The Blue Mountain Crystal Mine is an abandoned underground mine located beneath the once-popular Blue Mountain tourist destination, north-east to the NFC. Previously a key source of the rare and valuable mineral required for the production of Crystallized Energy, the mine fell into disrepair and obscurity following the invasion by an alien species.</p>
<p><del>The mine is situated approximately 25 to 150 km from the nearest towns and is generally only accessible by vehicle</del> <!--(Remark, #20230402) Change from original real-world source.-->The surrounding areas of the mine was a popular tourism village with a few thousand population. It used to be a beautiful small town. While no longer operational, the Blue Mountain Crystal Mine has a colorful and dark history that continues to influence the younger generation and inspire urban legends.</p>

<p>During the occupation of Krukians. Kruks invested significantly (using Tellurian resources anyway) to build and expand it, and those mining activities created complicated underground structures for the location. What's more, because they also serve as habitats for inslaved local people, even just for a short period of 5 years, there are lots of legacies left.</p>

<ul>
<li>How it was discovered.</li>

<h3 id="pre-invasion-era">Pre-Invasion Era</h3>
<p>Prior to the invasion, the Blue Mountain Crystal Mine was a local favorite, attracting visitors from far and wide for its scenic beauty and abundant resources. The site is distinguished by both the unique mountain range that it's nestled beneath and the rare, precious mineral that lends it its name: the Blue Mountain Crystal, which is largely unknown to the locals in the past. During the Krukian invastion, this mineral played a vital role in manufacturing advanced Crystallized Energy, which served as a high-capacity power source for numerous machines and devices.</p>
<h3 id="invasion-and-enslavement">Invasion and Enslavement</h3>
<p>The arrival of the Krukians brought about a drastic - and devastating - shift in the mine's history. For unknown reasons, the invading Kruks seized the location and began mass production of its energy-charged crystallized energy packs. As the need for the crystal increases, the aliens seized control of the surrounding regions, turning it into a forced labor camp for the local population. Among these enslaved workers were Tao Ye's parents, who, like many others, were captured and pressed into service.</p>
<h3 id="rebellion-and-aftermath">Rebellion and Aftermath</h3>
<p>In time, the human population rallied to rebel against their alien oppressors, driving them away and reclaiming the mine. But its legacy had drastically changed, transforming the once-popular destination to a grim battlefield stained by the blood of lost miners, leaving it an unwelcome reminder of the horrors endured by the enslaved workers. Now deserted, the mine has become haunted by the ghosts of the past, with local townspeople reluctant to visit or even speak of its existence. Yet this dark history has spawned a collection of urban legends and ghost stories that have prevailed throughout the generations.</p>
<h2 id="cultural-impact">Cultural Impact</h2>
<p>The Blue Mountain Crystal Mine serves as a pivotal location within the story, linking the Tao Ye's personal history to the oppressive alien regime. Tao Ye's epic but ultimately failed attempt at rescuing their enslaved parents takes place within the mine's claustrophobic, labyrinthine depths. Plenty of potential subplot ideas such as buried alien technology, decaying remnants of forced labor camps, and rumors of unearthly presences lurking within the mines can be used to enrich the narrative.</p>
<p>Despite its troubled past, the Blue Mountain Crystal Mine remains a site of evocative fascination for the younger generation, who practice daring games and exploration within its dark caverns. The mine's infamy and accessibility to the towns' vehicle-owning youth make it a potent symbol of youthful rebellion and thrill-seeking, forging a new subculture that seeks to reclaim the mine's grim past for themselves.</p>
