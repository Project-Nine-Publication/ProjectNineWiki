        <p>City: Rich Hill, in the municipality of Moana
Planet: Tellus
Type: Hospital, Assisted Living Complex</p>
<p><strong>Rich Hill Hillside Geriatric &amp; Rehabilitation Center</strong> (often referred to as <em>Hillside Geriatric</em> or <em>HGRC</em>) is a specialized healthcare facility providing short-term rehabilitation, long-term geriatric care, and palliative services to residents of <strong>Rich Hill</strong>, a town of approximately 250,000. The Center is situated on the western edge of Rich Hill, adjacent to a historic retirement community and assisted living complex once known as the <strong>Rich Hill Tuberculosis Sanatorium</strong>. Notably, a portion of the Center’s underground tunnels originated as a former military installation, which has since been adapted for emergency shelter against periodic <strong>Arcane Storms</strong> — a magical climate phenomenon unique to the region.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Geriatric &amp; Rehabilitation Hospital</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> West Rich Hill, near foothills and low mountains</li>
<li><strong>Beds:</strong> ~100 (split between rehabilitation, geriatric care, and palliative services)</li>
<li><strong>Affiliated with:</strong> <a href="#">Rich Hill Medical Center (RHMC)</a>, via a subterranean corridor</li>
<li><strong>Established:</strong> Mid-50th century (converted from a late 49th-century sanatorium)</li>
<li><strong>Known for:</strong> Underground bunker system, holistic therapy programs, specialized senior care</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="early-sanatorium-era">Early Sanatorium Era</h3>
<p>The hillside complex traces its origins to the year of <strong>4895</strong>, when local philanthropists funded the <strong>Rich Hill Tuberculosis Sanatorium</strong>, capitalizing on the area’s elevated terrain and purportedly “therapeutic” air currents. During the early 50th century, the site expanded to include multiple wards, pavilions, and convalescent gardens, catering to hundreds of patients seeking long-term TB treatment.</p>
<p>With the decline in tuberculosis prevalence and the development of effective antibiotic treatments in the mid-50th century, much of the sanatorium’s infrastructure became underutilized. Local authorities considered demolishing the site but ultimately chose to convert it into a geriatric facility, given Rich Hill’s growing senior population.</p>
<h3 id="cold-war-bunker-and-tunnel-network">Cold War Bunker and Tunnel Network</h3>
<p>From <strong>4955</strong> onward, a portion of the sanatorium’s outer grounds was quietly repurposed for <strong>military defensive infrastructure</strong> during the continent’s Cold War era. Engineers constructed reinforced bunkers and a <strong>network of tunnels</strong> under the hillside, intended to shelter key personnel and medical staff in the event of armed conflict or magical calamities.</p>
<p>Following decommission in the late 4970s, these bunkers remained in partial use for supply storage until the facility’s transition into a modern geriatric center. The subterranean corridors — several of which extend beyond the main building — were subsequently renovated to provide <strong>emergency shelter</strong> and connect HGRC with the larger <strong>Rich Hill Medical Center (RHMC)</strong>, located approximately 2 km away.</p>
<h3 id="conversion-to-a-modern-geriatric-rehabilitation-center">Conversion to a Modern Geriatric &amp; Rehabilitation Center</h3>
<p>By <strong>4990</strong>, the site was officially renamed the <strong>Rich Hill Hillside Geriatric &amp; Rehabilitation Center</strong>. Upgrades included converting old sanatorium wards into patient-friendly suites, installing modern therapy facilities, and creating specialized units for dementia care. The bunker system was also adapted for public safety, particularly for <strong>Arcane Storms</strong>, a magical weather phenomenon that occasionally impacts the region.</p>
<h2 id="arcane-storm-phenomenon">Arcane Storm Phenomenon</h2>
<p><strong>Arcane Storms</strong> are powerful, sporadic weather events tied to the planet’s unique magical climate. Characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intense flashes of luminescent energy</strong> in the sky, accompanied by atmospheric distortions.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid changes in atmospheric pressure</strong> that can cause severe health risks for vulnerable populations, including older adults and post-surgery patients.</li>
<li><strong>Localized disruptions in magical fields</strong>, potentially interfering with modern medical equipment if not properly shielded.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Hillside Geriatric campus uses its <strong>underground shelters</strong> for patient relocation during severe Arcane Storms, ensuring continuity of care and protection from fluctuating magical energies.</p>
