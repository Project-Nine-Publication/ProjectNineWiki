<p>The galactical-fixed locked location gateways are constructed by Medalians and by design/nature excludes Krukians (somehow).</p>
<h2 id="type-a">Type A</h2>
<p>This particular type of gateway are constructed with special kinds of matters and can only be constructed at places where the constructor have visited - i.e. to create communicating channel, the constructor must bring a particular type of entangled communication channel all the way to the destination from the starting point, and then the construction can begin at the destination. The gate way is then magnified with the existing communication channel. This is necessary because otherwise it's not really possible to arbitrarily locate a distant location in the universe precisely.</p>
<h2 id="type-b-stargates">Type B: Stargates</h2>
<p>Stargates, small teleportation gateways operate with different mechanism and with different limits and capabilities.</p>
<p>Some properties of Interstellar Transportation Stargates:</p>
<ol>
<li>It takes around 25-35 years for a travelling ship to arrive at the other end; During this time, they are beyond the dimension of this world in a hyper state;</li>
<li>The stars and cosmos background that one sees through the gate on in broken-glass like pieces reflects things that happened 25-35 years ago!</li>
<li>Exact travelling time depends on distance of course, and the broken pieces actually reflect the fact that there might be multiple connections through a single end point to many other end points (the system operates in a broadcast mechanism when it comes to receiving identifying signals and sending general non-directional signals).</li>
</ol>
<p>Stargates provides faster-than-light travel, in which case time-dialation calculation no longer follows the traditional &quot;light travel time&quot; calculation.
Stargates are different from other acceleration-based gateways, which controls speed well below speed of light or near-speed-of-light, and is very path-dependant and restricted in its use and distance.</p>
<p>A few notable mechanism:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accelerators: can travel only in straight line, and must avoid impacts, not faster-than-light.</li>
<li>Light Teleporters: information-system based transforpotation, exact as light-speed, rather light-weight to construct, require line-of-sight, may be warped by heavy mass objects, has security risk of leaking construct information.</li>
<li>Alcubierre drive: black-hole like mechanism, consumes lots of energy, requires extreme energy (near infinity) during operation or requires negative mass substance for construction, warps space in front and behind it, ignore impacts in path of travel, faster than light.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="operation">Operation</h3>
<p>The intergalactic stargates draws significant amount of energy and must be built near a star. During operation, the transportation vehicles (usually heavily protected) are aligned in space kept some distance away from the gate way. When the gateway stars, it draws energy directly from the star and produces a small-scale controlled blackhole, initiating the channel of communication (the blackhole can be sparked by an accelerator gun infrastructure). Then the transportation vehicles are accelerated by the usual acceleration rail, but this time instead of pointing outward the planet system, it's pointing at the black hole. The transportaion vehicles are shot into the black hole and proceeds to the other end of the universe. For longer distant transportation, a gateway might be built directly near a blackhole.</p>
<p>Once a tunnel is established, it can operate for a long time as long as the energy support is continuous. It takes roughly the same amount of time for a black hole to initiate connection with the reciprocal end (the total time it took to establish the connection must take into account of round trip time) as it takes to transport any given vehicle across the tunnel. The infrastructure might be operating on the quantum level, kind of like how a quantumn entanglement tunnel might work, except that in this case the original connection may or may not require initial seperation process (aka. it may be able to be established remotely) - however it's imaginable that it requires an initial seperation process of two already-quantum entabled elements in order to contain this level of connection information (i.e. it cannot be established remotely without an initial connection of some kind). That is, it requires a civilization to first travel to someplace with below-light speed, then later the quantum-gateway tunnel can be established with an already-entangled pair.</p>
<p>Sub-krukian species (or Xiramus) might possess the technology to remotely teleport without requiring initial connection.</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>In general, those long-distance object level teleportation requires detailed scanning devices. For Stargates, it operates using blackholes/wormholes so it's completely different. Kun's Portkey uses transport-layer protocol so it's also different. And Kun's Messaging Beacon uses long-distance quantum entanglement so it's also different.</p>
<p>Any other forms of faster-than-light travel generally follow GR (general relativity), meaning to the traveller he's travelling fater than light, but to the otherwise world, it's light that's transmitting (thus causing the time difference between the traveller and the destination).</p>
<p>(This might be a bad idea, pending re-volutionize the concept) Ever since the invention of Quantum Tunnel Scanning (or Photonic Scanning), there are multitude of issues related to duplicating quantum information <!--(Inspiration) https://baike.baidu.com/item/摇光/49940872-->  - in general, for any practical quantum teleportation, information CANNOT be duplicated or stored (because information at the quantum level is physical material rather than digital data). However, for the ancient Kruks, they invented a way to probe and replicate certain aspects of information at the human-brain level, thus making artificial brains. There are at least two different kinds of technologies for doing this: earlier prototypes uses artificial neurons, which apparent doesn't work due to its complexity and lack of certain quantum effects; Later invention of Quantum Tunnel Scanning enabled <strong>quantized printing</strong> at the electron level or actually sub-atomic level, thus creating <em>the abilities to print brains</em> <!--I wonder whether they can be this powerful, and whether artificial brains are digital, and whether it takes much more effort to produce a new artificial brain than simply programming some programs or whether it's possible to mass produce artificial brains at all; Either way, the cost of training an independant thinking individual is very hard-->? (We need to revoluntary means, it's hard to imagine producing 细胞骨架 （真核细胞中的蛋白纤维网架体系）with digital methods - even if manufacturing skills is really high - it can be done either biologically, which is less of a Kruks method but more of a Medalian method, or it should be done <strong>physicall</strong> - like how Machine Learning handles things mathematically, it should have a much simpler fundamental structure)</p>
