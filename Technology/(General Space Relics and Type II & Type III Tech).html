<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>(Project Nine, Technology, Myah) Neutrino communication - pass through all objects. Better and denser than lasers. It's giant, not portable and takes quite some space - but one can carry it on a spaceship.
(Project Nine, Sci-Fi, Idea) Human DNA contains hidden codes injected by designers - those codes contains messages, knowledge, and empowering abilities. (Maybe Myah cracked those codes - more efficient than having something like a Portkey) Also, our (Tellurian) age is at the twilight of civilization - the most glorious time has already passed. But that probably means there are lots of relics scattered across Galaxy (the galactic graveyard theory).
(Project Nine, Technology) Asteroid mining, planetary shields, Dyson swarm (with waste heat), Dyson sphere around blackhole, star lifting (harvest materials instead of energy from stars), Dark Space (Type III galaxy giant civilization), Satellite field around planet, Cosmic Time Capsule (a great megastructure of memory vaults containing great knowledge, some shared by different civilizations, well protected by layers of protocols), Astro Engineer/Engineering.
