<!--Unrecorded Dream; Sourced and also available on Dated notes, pending development. Originally conveived per 20220517. -->
<p>Since alien invasion they discovered ancient sea life remains in their technology and that promoted a wave of deep sea exploration to discover potential alternative and relevant sources of that - eventually they discovered giant 海绵 like cliff-like structures that contains rich internal juices (and is huge pollution as well) - those are the foundation of the entire 煌/鳇/鐄/皝/晄能industry。The harvested liquid material cannbe made into a widr variety of products and entire habitats of under water environment is built to accommodate such underwater needs (it's so deep 海洋工作平台 like oil platforms can't reach? Or just for sci-fi purpose it's cooler if it's underwater). There are at the moment only 1 or 3 companies that can possibly afford this and they have an alliance to monopoly and support each others. Urban legends have it such industries have crazy pollutions and (according to the dream) brave young rebellions/vigelantate tried to break into those places recklessly and sabotage their systems. Those companies have sites near shores will usually control the entire economy of the shore towns. It's clearly an advanced near-futute era since along the shore to avoid sabotage on land and on water, they hired &quot;kids&quot; and other workers that pretend to be ordinary street workers but whose eyes are artificial eyeballs that sends visual information back to the data center for analyses of intruders (wouldn't it be cheaper to just use hidden cameras?)</p>
