<p>You think this would require advanced control system; Not really.</p>
<p>Looks like this thing depends on weight on the lower portion - the smaller wheels drives the rim.</p>

<p>Originally thought this is very cool but pending deprecation and come up with better and new ideas if applicable.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the steering problem, monowheels have never caught on as a widely accepted mode of transportation.&quot; Also see this page on other issues: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monowheel">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monowheel</a>, and relatively high center of gravity makes it hard to stop and control the stability. The risk of &quot;gerbiling&quot; is especially bad but can be controlled with active designs that limits braking. &quot;In driver-inside designs, the rider is always facing the inner rim of the wheel, which can obstruct the view of oncoming hazards from all angles.&quot; is very bad as well - this can be overcome by a tilted design.</p>
