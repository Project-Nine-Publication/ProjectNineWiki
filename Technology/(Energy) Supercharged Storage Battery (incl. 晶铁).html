<p>Medalian technology can turn any sort of crystallized structure into energy storage device, aka. batteries - apparently, certain crystals are better than others in holding energy. Such batteries can either exhibit better energy capacity in general, or have one-shot super high voltage (for specialized usages) - which are dangerous when not handled properly. Most of these are radiactive, so a protective metal shell is necessary for proper storage.</p>
<p>Some types of this material/device is called 晶铁. However, even Medalians are not super efficient in producing this kind of devices - surprisingly (or not surprisingly because Kruks are just better in tech in general than Miah), the better, more dense-storage and higher-charge (multi-shot voltage) crystalized batteries are created and used abundantly by Kruks.</p>
<h2 id="phenomenon">Phenomenon</h2>
<p>During the time when Medalians (and Kruks) was on Earth - especially the The Great War period when quick dirty and one-time use batteries are needed - lots of such energized crystals are created and left on Earth. One notable location of production is the infamous Blue Mountain Crystal Mine, which was one time a concentration camp for forced Tellurian labours, and a place where large scale mining of underground crystals and minerals was done, and much of the crystallized batteries was created with legacies left.</p>
<p>(Magic) Such crystallized charges or supercharged crystals might be surprising effect on certain Tellurian people, given them &quot;ultrahuman&quot; power. <!--See whether we can correlate this with that "口吐小剑" (at train station in a western desert-side town) and secretive crystal retailer (likely in D19) dream.--></p>

<!--参见：Tiddly Wiki - 原九层楼记梦 - Remarks (Migrated), [[晶铁]]，[[邪教]]-->
<p>小男孩去收集这些散落的水晶是一类[[信仰团体]]的行为，他们认为这一些水晶因为其独特的构造和vibiration可以提供spiritual energy，在一部分人的信仰中这样一种Vibirational Energy附近形成的能量场能够帮助他们所信奉的人——？？？——来定位他们，从而接近和向他们传递信息。</p>
<p>事实是这一类水晶首先是陆地表面层次不齐的嘈杂品质，另外也不是晶铁，并不具有特殊的能量功能。但是对于闪族人而言会使用这种水晶for Purely aesthetical purpose来作为[[灵魂容器]]。持有这样水晶很多、并且暗自信奉自己的神性存在的信徒会受到来自这一些[[闪族]]人的主动联系，去执行一些人物、获得一些特殊的鼓励（例如hack的CP点数），逐渐引导更加深入到教徒群体之中。</p>
<p>最终会引导他们去进行[[超度仪式]]，将其灵魂引导离开这个世界。其实是进行brain replacement，将其置换为闪族人。之前的洗脑足够成功的话，置换之后不管是否是承诺的paradise，反正都与“神”（待重新命名）成为一体了，不会很计较。</p>

<h3 id="the-crystal-capacitor">The Crystal Capacitor</h3>
<p>In the year 2154 on Tellus, humanity's increasing reliance on renewable energy sources and electric transportation modes necessitated the development of batteries with even greater energy density and faster charging times. Scientists across the globe were frantically researching new materials and methods to improve battery technology.</p>
<p>Dr. Elara Sterling, a brilliant material scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery during her research on crystallized structures of metallic compounds. She found that specific crystalline structures exhibited superior charge storage capacity and rapid energy transfer capabilities. These unique crystals offered the potential to completely revolutionize battery technology, far surpassing the performance of lithium-ion and solid-state batteries.</p>
<p>Embarking on a quest to actualize her findings, Dr. Sterling assembled a team of leading scientists and engineers to develop these &quot;Crystal Capacitors.&quot; Unknown to her, a greedy and unscrupulous organization with eyes on the potential fortune to be gained from her research sought to steal the technology for its profit-driven goals.</p>
<p>The Crystal Capacitor paints a captivating tale of scientific ingenuity, corporate greed, and the ethical challenges that come with the power offered by cutting-edge technology. Our protagonists must face the relentless pursuit of this nefarious organization while trying to ensure that their revolutionary invention benefits all of humankind. Along the way, they discover that the crystalline structures offer not only untold energy storage capacity but also unlock secrets of physics previously believed to be mere fantasy.</p>
