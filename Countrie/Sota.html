        <p>Sota is a developing country with large populations and abundant resources and mid-length history. It's the manufacturing center of the present world for Medalian space industry. Because of its nature as developing country, a lot of stuff there is NOT regulated and 山寨 industry is very robust. Cheap manufacturing of all kinds are readily accessible in all regions of the country - a lot of stuff would otherwise be not permitted in other countries.</p>
<p>Sota is a generally speaking, poor middle east country with somewhat abundant water resources.
The local traditional language (besides modern Medalian) is Sotian/Sotin (梭天语、梭天文).</p>
