<p>(Idea from) Why are (most) females in our reality so inferior, intellectually and emotionally speaking, notably in China (actually most western woman are pretty much the same as man it seemed)? We should have a kingdom where females are predominant and dominant, ideally without man at all - for instance, they can exclusively use sperm banks for choice of ideal breeding and send out all instances of male babies. Hard to imagine how this is enforced on the government level - maybe not through laws and law enforcements, but more through (like China) long-time 传统观念. No matter how we develop it, it's a very morally interesting topic and is very relevant to Euphoria and The Last Order's gender/marriage/romance movements.</p>
<p>(MOdel) Instead of being a &quot;kingdom&quot;, which sounds aggressive, maybe it should be an independant (city) state within an open country, e.g. something similar to NFC's context.</p>
<p>(Concept) There is a very new concept (related to modernity, and overall change of perspective in marriage): &quot;When a person or a couple wants a baby and needs a different ingredient than what they’ve currently got to make one, a man with viable sperm swoops in to help.&quot; This is a further facility to remove the traditional boundaries of &quot;true-love&quot; and all that considerations in a marriage. On the contrary, you know how some kids are so stubbornly stupidly interested in the distinction between &quot;biological father/mother&quot; and &quot;foster father/mother&quot;? Having a donated sperm or even a donated embryo can seem to have such problems - having such donations from friends can help alleviate this if the relationship are close. Per <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/07/sperm-donations-emotional-consequences/564587/">this post</a>: &quot;he finds male partners to be “much more attached to these ideas of ownership and [the child being] ‘mine,’ and much more tied to the genetic connection in terms of what it means psychologically or what it means emotionally”&quot; - stupid males.</p>
