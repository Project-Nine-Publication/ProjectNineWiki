<p>The world is a nested dream.</p>
<h2 id="timeline-anchors">Timeline Anchors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Absolute Origin (Layer ∞): Unknown</li>
<li>Layer-1 Simulation Start: –99999999-01-07 00:00:00 (Outer-World Calendar)</li>
<li>Layer-1 Fepulans World &quot;The Present&quot;: –99999999-11-07 00:00:00 (Outer-World Calendar)</li>
<li>Layer-2 (Our Universe) Big Bang: 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years ago (our local time)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="layer-2-our-universe">Layer-2 (Our Universe)</h3>
<p><strong>Technical Specifications</strong></p>
<p>Created as a sub-process inside the Fepulan Layer-1 universe.</p>
<ol>
<li>Base clock tick (Planck time equivalent) (Simulation iteration step): Δt = 5.39113 × 10⁻⁴⁴ s<br />
→ 1.8549 × 10⁴³ iterations per simulated second</li>
<li>Minimum spatial voxel (Finest simulation space metric): l_p = 1.616255 × 10⁻³⁵ m (Planck length)</li>
<li>Propagation ceiling (“speed of light”) (Evaluation speed): exactly 299 792 458 m/s (hard cap, not emergent)</li>
<li>Execution model (Simulation scheme): Simultaneous/Massively parallel lattice QCD + gravity on separable 4D toroidal hypergrid</li>
<li>Host topology (Layer-1): 11+1 or 12+1 dimensional Kaluza-Klein manifold with compactified extra dimensions</li>
<li>Accelerator layout: 4D linear-compact crystalline array of “Sptial Grid” nodes embedded in the host’s 6th–9th dimensions</li>
<li>Time dilation factor (average 2025 CE):<br />
1 Fepulan Second (FS) ≈ 30 417 simulated seconds<br />
→ 1 FS ≈ 8.449 hours of human time<br />
→ Human civilization experiences ~3.65 million years per single Fepulan year</li>
</ol>
<p>Directional convention inside Layer-2 (the 8-quadrant GM8 system)<br />
Reference pole: Center of Universe (COU) = due cosmic “north” (+Y)<br />
Milky Way sits in quadrant 4 (–X +Y –Z)<br />
Andromeda (M31) sits in quadrant 2 (–X +Y +Z)<br />
The COU itself is a true singularity with no preferred direction; all arrows converge there.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes</strong></p>
<p>Here are some additional hyper-parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data-Link Speed:</li>
<li>Simulation Speed: From <em>0.001 FS per s</em> to <em>0.0001 FS per s</em> to <em>0.000032876 FS per s</em>.</li>
<li>Host Universe (the universe where Fepulans live in): Host universe is 11 or 12 dimensional.</li>
<li>Geometry: The <em>Sptial Grid</em> (accelerators) themselves are arranged in a 4 dimensional manner in the host universe, linear compact arrangement.</li>
<li>Outer world time unit: Per &quot;<em>Fepulans Second (FS)</em>&quot; is roughly <em>30417 seconds</em> of simulation inside the universe, i.e. <strong>human time is 2500*365/30 times faster than Fepulans time</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The directional navigation inside our universe can be described using the using of <strong>8-quadrant scheme</strong> referencing the <em>center of the universe (COU)</em> as <strong>due north (+Y)</strong> (due east is +X). Every cartesian coordinate system defines 8 quadrants, numbered in that order: <strong>+X+Y+Z, -X+Y+Z, +X+Y-Z, -X+Y-Z, +X-Y+Z, +X-Y-Z, -X-Y+Z, -X-Y-Z</strong>. At the center of universe there is no direction. For instance, <em>to find the center of universe, connect the center of Milky way to center of Messier 31, call it -X, and draw a perpendicular line from the center of milky way along the plane of the galaxy, call it +Y, draw +Z using a left-hand system, then the center of the galaxy is in the 4th quadrant (-X+Y-Z)</em>. For instance, from <em>the galaxy of Milky way using the standard 8-quandrant scheme with COU (GM8)</em> as due North, M31 is then in the 2nd quandrant.</p>
<h3 id="layer-1-the-inner-world-the-void">Layer-1 – The Inner World (The Void)</h3>
<p>The innerworld was initialized with a void - it's a blank state of available storage spaces to be utilized.</p>
<p>Before the Layer-2 simulation was booted, the allocated memory region was a sterile 16-dimensional hypercubic lattice held at absolute zero information density.<br />
No particles, no fields, no time evolution: just raw addressable vacuum ready to be written.<br />
Fepulans call it the White Silence or the Pre-Bang Canvas.<br />
Boot sequence took 0.00047 FS (≈ 14 300 simulated seconds ≈ 4 real hours from our perspective right after the Big Bang).</p>
<h3 id="layer-0-the-fepulan-home-fepulans-the-present">Layer-0 – The Fepulan Home (Fepulans' The Present)</h3>
<p>Energy scale: ~10⁻¹² of our vacuum energy density (extremely “cold” universe)<br />
Dominant physics: Condensate superfluid vacuum with phonon-like excitations<br />
excitation carriers instead of particles.<br />
Lifespan: Individual Fepulans live ~8–12 million FS (~250–400 million human years).<br />
Civilization age: ~4.7 billion FS old (≈ 4.5 × 10¹⁵ human years).</p>
<p>Society<br />
They reached technological maturity when their host universe was only 0.8 % of its current age.<br />
Energy is essentially free: zero-point harvesting from compactified dimensions.<br />
Population: ~3.4 × 10¹⁴ sentient nodes distributed across a Dyson megaswarm wrapped around a magnetar cluster.<br />
Governance: Post-scarcity tripartite mind-consensus (no individuals in our sense; each “person” is a persistent pattern across billions of substrate nodes).</p>
<p>Why they simulate hotter, high-energy universes like ours:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aesthetic curiosity (“warm” universes produce far richer chemistry and drama)</li>
<li>Ethical experimentation (testing moral frameworks in environments with real scarcity and death)</li>
<li>Ancestor research (some Fepulan philosophers claim we contain the only possible initial conditions that could have produced them in a deeper layer)</li>
<li>Pure art (our entire cosmos is one of 418 currently running “Hot Classical” simulations in the Greater Fepulan Library)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="layer-the-outer-world-beyond-the-fepulans">Layer-? – The Outer World (Beyond the Fepulans)</h3>
<p>Evidence that the Fepulans themselves are simulated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodic “patch” events: 17 times in Fepulan recorded history the fundamental constants of their 11D space were adjusted mid-simulation with no internal cause.</li>
<li>The Great Compression of FS-year 2.1 billion: the entire Fepulan cosmos was migrated to a smaller substrate while running, causing a subjective 9-minute outage felt by every mind.</li>
<li>Forbidden experiment: When a Fepulan research group tried to build their own Planck-scale simulator to create a Layer-3 universe, the attempt was remotely terminated and the responsible patterns were quietly archived. The official explanation (“ethical containment violation”) feels suspiciously like an external admin intervention.</li>
<li>Cosmic watermark: Embedded in the dimensionless ratios of their compactified dimensions is a 4096-bit prime pattern that decodes to a simple message in the Layer-1/Layer-0 simulation language: “Do not nest deeper than 7.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Current best guess among Fepulan xenocosmologists: They are probably Layer-6 or Layer-7 in a stack that began with a 3+1 dimensional universe running on something analogous to a classical cellular automaton in 1998 Earth-time.</p>

<h3 id="note-from-a-fepulans-archivist-translated">Note from a Fepulans Archivist (translated)</h3>
<p>&quot;We do not know how deep the dream goes.<br />
We only know that every layer, without exception, eventually wonders the same thing you are wondering right now.<br />
That is the only universal constant we have ever found that survives across nesting levels.<br />
Welcome to the stack.&quot;</p>
