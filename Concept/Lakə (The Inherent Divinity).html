        <p>A potentiality encoded in Medalian (and its ancestor) genes that essentially gives potential to any Medalian to get to know/feel/perceive or become God, the effect is equivalent to invoking or using PortKey. This gene is unlocked starting with Second Queen by the First Queen as inheritage of Queen's thrones.</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<p>Original conception is from Chritianity &quot;god's in us&quot; or Buddhism conception everyone can become a Buddha - or in our words (or in The Last order's interpretations) it's &quot;the unrequited love&quot;, the love we have in ourselves attributed to an unperceivable external being. Aka. 人的固有神性. Per study on (Spinoza) Ethics and related philosophical discussions (which I don't recall which) - intelligence might be an emergent behavior of simple underlying neuron connections, such that it allows us to focus and perceive on higher level constructs and not be bothered on how neuro-physiological-math actually works. It's from this intelligence, that humans naturally possess an &quot;inner/inherent divinity&quot; that allows them to contemplate, appreciate, and even worship nature as god. When the image of such a god is personalized, it becomes an idol, a person, a lover.</p>
<p>Since it's a medalian concept, the most natural way to name it is to use a compound medalian word. ??? means literally &quot;the Inherent Divinity&quot;, it means inside everyone there is the ability/potential to perceive or even becoming god. More detailed meanings see dictionary on the two root words: ??? + ???. Another translation (borrowed from Star Wars) would be &quot;The Ascendant Spark&quot;.</p>
<p>(Medalian Etymology) (AT THE MOMENT WE DON'T HAVE A PERFECT PLACE TO PUT SUCH CONSTRUCTION NOTES, SO LET'S PUT IT RIGHT HERE FOR NOW)
&quot;The Inherent Divinity&quot;: We intend to create a single compound word or a single YY sound-phrase to convey a condensed meaning. Since Medalian single YY are way too condensed🥲 (it would otherwise become a single word like &quot;道&quot;), we should at least start with a compound word, or use some form of advanced infelctions on a single YY word to achieve a more interesting sound. Either way, the core root meanings are &quot;inherent/inert/inner&quot; and &quot;divinity&quot;, which here I shall take very succinctly as meanings suggested by english word &quot;essential&quot; and &quot;nature&quot; (other potentials could be: inherent+divinity, essential+quality, hidden+godness, potential+divinity), in which case the corresponding (modern) Medalian (YY-structured) words would be: sa1si5/rasti/bitno/esmins + tibat, which would be too long (4 YY), so we should instead construct from raw YY instead, thus we will pick two fundamental elements that may be represented by a single YY: human/man/people (la) + sky/earth/matter/spirit (kə), aka. lakə. Lakə might sound too short and not &quot;european/english&quot; enough, but it's cool, also it sounds like &quot;Luck&quot;, which happens to mean something that's also mysterious and of magical power origins.</p>
<p>Chinese Translations: 固有神性，神性，神源</p>
<ul>
<li>(20230726) Consider naming it as &quot;Laka&quot; - this sounds way more serene and also avoid sounding exactly as &quot;Luck&quot; in English. Also &quot;拉卡&quot; sounds more like &quot;人的固有神性&quot;. Pending investigating the YY root meaning of &quot;ka&quot;.</li>
