<p>Queens are the most powerful entities made by Medalians for the ptection of its civilization. They are medala-like but sophisticated machine underneath. In a sense, Medalians have done something they claimed wrong in order to fight the wrong - by making a medala into a long-lasting and powerful nano-machine, they are able to fight with those eternal machines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Queens all have very distinct look, and not all of them look like human. They come from different original regions/countries, and have distinct, and sometimes personal goals, even though they all share the same &quot;will&quot;.
(PUT THOSE IN DISTINCT QUEEN'S OWN WIKI ENTRYE) Queen 6 is a serious-looking and daunting looking golden plate armoured figure while Queen 3 is very humane and somewhat more cheer, while other queens all have distinct personality. Queen 7 is a rather serious-faced human-like individual due to her conflicting persuits and difficult life-path. 3 out of 7 (excluding upcoming Zarna) comes from Konralika.</p>
<p>The Seven Queens of Medala (Doita Ti Medala):</p>
<ol>
<li>Ora Busa Lika 欧拉布萨里卡</li>
<li>Ora Heya Yuit 欧若赫雅优衣特</li>
<li>Ora Heya Kamita 欧拉赫雅卡米塔</li>
<li>Ora Uaika Minva 欧拉瓦以卡明娃</li>
<li>Ora Chamurika 欧若长幕瑞卡</li>
<li>Ora Sevia Tuma 欧拉赛维亚托玛</li>
<li>Ora Sham Dζlinm (Deylim) 欧拉闪得琳 (Known as Doita Dəlin)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>(Power, Technology, physics) The Queen can borrow vacuum energy (through &quot;virtual particles&quot;)? And as long as she &quot;replays&quot; those energy back, it won't even disturb the conversation of energy except only in a localized region within limited timespan - the longer she borrows the less that's available to be borrowed. For very short (instant) actions she can theoratically borrow unlimited amount of energy out of vacuum - but if there is matter around (which there usually is near planet surfaces) there is more available resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<p>(经典) 在原先的《塔》(原威斯波尔记梦)中，天来女王被称作“后皇（意思是女性的皇帝）”或者“后”。意味“后天黄土，天地的代称，母后为大。”
* 《三国志·魏志·后妃传序》：“汉制，帝祖母曰太皇太后，帝母曰皇太后，帝后曰皇后，期于内官十有四等。魏因汉法，母后之号，皆如旧制。”  母后主要指皇太后。也可泛指太皇太后，皇太后和皇后。此处我们取泛指意。
* 天来女王我们之前发展的是类似于君王制度，但是现在打算演变为一种”圣贤体制”，在于作为女王其不仅仅是能力而且理解力要远超脱于寻常世人、倒是多一些道家仙佛思想、无为之治、天地不仁。“体止而用无穷兮，播生者於迷津”（《录梦篇-黄庭坚》）。

<h2 id="the-mission">The Mission</h2>
<p>The queens and maybe the inner council are the ONLY people that knows about the true legend (though arguably the first queen published some writing on the dialogue with our creator, subject to interpretation) - they are vowed to protect one truth/fact from the rest of the world: that our world is made up by some intelligent being, that it's not real <!--Why would that? How much damage can this fact possibly have on people? How affirmative is it, and even if it's told why would people belive in this?-->.</p>
<p><strong>The Fundamental Truth</strong></p>
<!--We must make it clear: if the protected truth the world is ficticious and that outside the protected realms the world is completely wild, or the truth is the world is going to end? Also it would be interesting to consider the possibility that the Fepulans made the offer to those who originally get in contact with the Portkey that if they do certain things, the Fepulans can grant them the ability to live after death in the unprotected realm, and hence to avoid such, the Medalian queens stopped offering the Portkey to the general public-->
<p>The first queen, Ora Busa Lika, had a lengthy (potentially ongoing until her transferring the throne) dialog with the creators. The truth about our universe is written in a book by her later when she exits the innerworld.</p>
<p>Busa Lika didn’t write in the oracle book that the world is going to end in 100,000 years (calculated in human years). She didn’t tell anyone else about it - this knowledge shall be passed only through the lineage of the throne. If that is the case, if they alone knows this <strong>ultimate truth</strong>, then they do have the sufficient initiative to make such a judgment that, as their <strong>sacred goal</strong>, they will strive to <strong>maintain peace and order for all during this last period of time of intelligent lives and humaneness/benevolence/humanity/civilization</strong>. That thread of thinking will give them authority for a seemingly totalitarian governance for the empire and maybe even reaches beyond. (Remark <!--We need to consider how/what’s their altitude on the human races - do they include humans as part of their autonomy or nothing more than a separate race like others in the universe. Or maybe one purpose of the expedition trip, through preaching, to see whether humans can be considered as part of “us” or “them”.-->)</p>
<h2 id="thrones-of-queens">Thrones of Queens</h2>
<p>Queens are the leaders of the <strong>Miah</strong> identity. And since Miah is the leader of the union of the Medalian Empire, Queen is highest unit of power across the <strong>Medalian Empire</strong>. The empire is constituted with Kingdoms, Unions etc across the <strong>Doma system</strong> and even sometimes spread a bit over across its galaxy <!--Per current understanding, the Medalian civilization is largely confined to the Doma system,  though this may seem small - Doma system is very well established. There may be new development of civilizations along the “Silk Road” but they are small and not super mature yet.-->.</p>
<p>Notice the governing structure is less like <em>Constitutional monarchy</em> but <strong>more of a Caesaropapism or Theocracy</strong> <!--The full name of this might be called “theocratic absolute elective monarchy”, a kind of “non-hereditary monarchy”, like Vatican City.-->, where Queen is like the God (lesser as a mere messenger or archbiship of the God).</p>
<p>All Queens (present and past) are collectively named, as a romanization, as <strong>Kun</strong> <!--臣下和寻常时人们直接称呼女王为去王号珺，不用实名，历史事件可以使用实名。-->.</p>
<p>There are currently <strong>Seven Queens of Medala</strong> (<strong>Doita Ti Medala</strong>):</p>
<ol>
<li>Orab Lyika 奥拉布丽卡</li>
<li>Orab Heyut 欧若赫优特</li>
<li>Ora Heya Kamita 欧拉赫雅卡米塔</li>
<li>Ora Uaika Minva 欧拉瓦以卡明娃</li>
<li>Ora Chamurika 欧若长幕瑞卡</li>
<li>Ora Sevia Tuma 欧拉赛维亚托玛</li>
<li>Orab Sham Dζlinm 奥拉布闪得琳 (Known as Doita Dəlin)</li>
<li>(Selected) Zarna Doqima (“珺胤”)</li>
</ol>
<p>As of “now”, the first Queen has already transcended (passed away); And Kun VII has an unknown status.</p>

<h2 id="duty">Duty</h2>
<p>A queen can have very legit and well balanced personal life for she contributes a lot to her civilization. The Queens private army constitute of <strong>49 generals</strong> and <strong>49000 soldiers</strong>. Each general lives an ordinary Miah people's life, i.e. around 200 years and usually not more than <em>250 years</em> (Medalian calender).</p>
<p>A Queen serves a very very strong military purpose and civilization role (though such roles are slightly altered per each queen), I.e. <strong>to take expeditions and go to explore other civilizations with greater depth and responsible for the well-being of the whole civilization on a much longer time scale</strong>.</p>

<p>(Remark) Just in case you wonder: we don’t necessarily need to start with the embryo for genetic modifications; We can do localized genetic modifications, for instance, on the stem cells.</p>
<p>1000 people is selected for training during youth and can become queen 1000 years after birth, then it serves as queen for 1000 years, then serve as Chancellor for the queen.</p>
<p>Queens' direct blood heritage[[ Yes, Queens will have mates and can have direct blood lineage.
Charles.Zhang, 12/29/2021 16:19]] will inherit some of the genetically modified qualities of the queen but that's not the necessary condition for becoming the next queen, in fact the next queen is usually not selected from the blood heritages but as stated previously, among the selected <strong>students</strong>.</p>
<p>When a student is selected she will start taking modifications[[ Actually I need a Medalian word for this that means “Super-Medala”, which is effectively what they are making.
Charles.Zhang, 12/29/2021 16:25]] (both mechanical, physical, biochemical and genetically, so it’s a long and slow process) and gradually become qualified as a queen.</p>
<p>Upon formal designation as a Queen, a lethal dose of transforming potion will be taken and 1 of the 3 final candidates will be selected. The remaining 2 are either dead or work as secretary.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>A Miah person never retire during her life and the delegation of job is usually permanent - though to avoid specialization and all issues with it, the training of specialists have very strong focus on <strong>interdisciplinary development</strong>, the same applies to education to general public as well (partly because Miah people receive <em>over 30 or even 50 years</em> of formal education before making a decision on eternal job designation). The implication is: <strong>Queens can never have private relations with many people (because Queen outlive them)</strong> - in fact the only long term association a Queen will have are her Chancellors.</p>
