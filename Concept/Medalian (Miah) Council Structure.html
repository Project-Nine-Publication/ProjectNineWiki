        <!--(Idea, culture, queen) When the 6th queen takes the ritual and departs, the most memorable people/special memory she shall have would be with her students and the other Chancellors. Notice Chancellors don't have private army.
(Reference) 参照三权分立-->
<p>There are currently 6 <strong>Chancellors</strong> in the council, title as <strong>Kun I</strong> to <strong>Kun VI</strong>.</p>
<p>There are <strong>at most 7 Chancellors</strong>[[ What happens to older queens? Or maybe it haven’t happened yet.
Sounds like if there is anyone who wants to escape her duty, that would be the first Queen or the fifth queen (randomly chosen) rather than the last and latest queen.]] (number pending) at any given time so each Queen's life can be a total of <em>8000 medalian years</em>.</p>
<p>The Chancellors have literally no power whatsoever and their sole duty is to <strong>chancel the current Queen</strong> and <strong>educate new queens</strong>. A Chancellor is not a Queen's secretary, on the other hand, a Chancellor can even direct important tasks a queen should take care of (so instead of merely serving the current Queen, they are supervising it). Chancellors are like Queens personal consultants. The queen makes all the important decisions, subject to objection from the Chancellor - and such objections are public.</p>
<p>Queen respects Chancellors for they are repository of huge amount of knowledge. A queen has absolutely no power whatever to dismiss a Chancellor nor influence education of new Queens (except during intimate Expedition trainings).</p>
<p>When a Queen takes an expedition, which can usually take more than <strong>a few hundred years</strong>, the Chancellors will make decisions together. Queen herself is not critical to the general functioning of the civilization itself - for those the <strong>Chancellors</strong>, <strong>secretaries</strong>, <strong>councils</strong>, and everyone else can take care of.</p>
<p>All Chancellors and the Queen have <strong>7000 additional years</strong> to live (since first becoming a Queen) and <strong>each will have the supernatural power of a Queen</strong>[[ This is how Kun VI can come to Earth without worrying about being defeated easily.]] (<strong>without relying on the Portkey</strong>). But Chancellors are usually forbidden to summon such power, besides the fact that only the current Queen holds the Portkey which is a very critical device.</p>
<p>Since the Queen cannot directly control the Chancellors, the <strong>(civil) council</strong> can execute Chancellor if necessary - and the council strictly represent people and are <strong>very very very much educated</strong>[[ In a sense, it’s an Elite-led council. Practically the only thing(s) they don’t know are the secrets of the Queens, the transformation potions and intricate details of the modification process.]]. Among the general public their interests usually don't lie on the Queen, but the <strong>councilors (different from Chancellors)</strong>. Councilors regularly give speeches and show their own policies among different divisions of the civilization space.</p>
<p><strong>The Supreme Court</strong> serves Chancellor only, and the Supreme Court owns <strong>the Divine Weapon</strong> whose sole function is to execute the Queen and her Chancellors and related entities (<strong>Queen's Private Army</strong>). Unlike an actual army, the Divine Weapon is a <em>machine</em> that can kill in instant anywhere <strong>inside the domain</strong>, and is activated only through the Supreme Court's consensus (requires the majority vote from the Council and 3 or more from the Chancellors).</p>
<p><strong>The Civil Council</strong> and the Queen alone is responsible for legislation; The execution of civil functions is spread across entities; Queen and The Chancellors are responsible for military and civilization superiority; Law execution is also managed by civil constructs, with the execution of Civilization Level (I.e. Queen Level) owned by the supreme court.</p>
<p>Notice per separation of power Queen's Private Army doesn't directly obey the queen - on the contrary, they obey to <strong>Queen's Will</strong>, which is sort of like the law that states what the soldiers should do. As such, the army don't directly &quot;take order&quot; from the queen, but rather the queen &quot;<em>asks the army</em>&quot; and the army will do only if they deem correct. The Army itself receives resource from the civil. <strong>In an expedition such rules must be relaxed and the relations must be more flexible/messy, and is pending further investigation</strong>.</p>
