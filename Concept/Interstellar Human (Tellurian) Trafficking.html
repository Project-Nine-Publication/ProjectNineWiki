<li>(Plot, theme, style, 魔幻现实, #Novel, #Content, Management) Medalian people buy, sell, capture, and showcase enslaved humans - this is unavoidable since the security on earth and technology on earth is so low and easily penetratable, anyone with that capacity will immediately seize the market and make a profit - there will definitely be at least a few dozen people having this need, idea and desire to visit humans, and when such needs cannot be easily satisfied by joining the expedition team, they will seek a &quot;twisted&quot; version of the realization, thus folstering the inter-galactic slave business. Such enslaving is manefested in many many aspects, from simple pet stores in the Undercity to captures and transportation (human trafficking) to prostitution to child marriage to much more elaborate trained individual human servants with high status. The trade involves all countries, all levels of government, politics and bribery. Other more interesting manifesctations include <strong>paintings</strong> - from basic illustration as record of individuals, to illustrations of activities performed by enslaved people, to more expensive Exotic Oil painted masterfully crafted piece of arts of those people, sold back to the original planet (also it's worth mentioning despite the high level of space technology, the diverse culture and long historical heritage of Medala necessarily implies that the development will NOT be universal or equal - e.g. some parts of Kai will be much more highly developed than other parts, and the more rural parts of the source planets might even be considered &quot;rural&quot;). The key here for the purpose of the novel is to make it bizarre - and think back and in reference to the slave trade, and those events described in the two novels: <strong>百年孤独</strong> and <strong>Candide</strong>.
<ul>
<li>(Event, people, company, name, theme, 魔幻现实) What's more, behind all those human rights violation, slave trade is not just the Medalians themselves - the large-scale seemingly legit operation that handles inter-steller business with aliens (rise much later in the 2030s, after Xiao Kan and Eleven Baker was captured as earlier more under-the-ground trading victims) <strong>Interstellar Operation</strong> rise as the glorified version of this slave trading, even offering things like space travel and tours, tightly collaborating other space agencies and rocket manufacturer and official businesses from the Medalian world - their symbol is a human head of a captain/astronous guy with collars and style that resembles either an astranout or comic-style 20th century Star Trek like spacesuit. Their leader is a huamn (pending name, make it western name) - the human head leader that knows and operates such high-stake business of slave trading. The prices of slaves are high, and humans are in high demand by those Medalians. ¶The hit rate is 1 in 100 due to near-earth debris despite the company's effort to clean things up, what's more, every hit causes more debris. But people just want such experience so badly (like they climb the Mt Everest).</li>
