        <p>Origin: Kai
Species: Medala - Miah
Birth:
Age: 378 # Calendar, counting from birth to present day
Real Age: 145 # Actual awaken years/Biological years, excluding sleep and hypersleep during space travel</p>
<p>Non-Biological Daughter: 冷雪映</p>
<p>He has the duty as deputy of the Queen to take care of everyone untill Queen returns. Kruks do not listen to him and due to the hostile altitude of Tellurians towards Medalians, it's not easy to manage. For that reason Mr. Leng build Undercity as a fortress under NFC.</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<p>老爷子（冷先生）：冷晏笑/冷先胜/玦</p>
<p>Names: Mr. Leng, 冷先胜
Nickname: Mr. Leng
冷先胜的英文称呼: Mr. Leng可以接受，但是下属称呼其一般使用Master Leng吧。在家会犹豫做些什么、好似很安全很无碍，走出去才可以获得那种<strong>active energy</strong>。</p>
<p>Medalian Name: Nafuxi (那伏西, from &quot;Nüwa&quot; and &quot;Fuxi&quot; along with &quot;Feng风&quot;) (Is that full name or just first name?) -&gt; Nafusu -&gt; Nafux (Navusi)</p>
<p>Somewhere else mentioned he's called &quot;Ushikima&quot;. Well, this could be his (Japanese style) name.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Originally born on Kai in a (what kind of family)....</p>
<h2 id="entrance-to-the-inner-world">Entrance to the Inner World</h2>
<p>Mr. Leng’s mystical studies are for the purpose of seeking a way to live forever - while he’s kept young using Kruks’ technologies, he’s quickly aging under the hood, even with Kun VII’s blessing early on (when Kun VII’s gone, he receives no such blessing).</p>
<p>The Sky Dome was only created when Mr. Leng’s inside the Innerworld (in a manifestation called The Many Worlds) - but he only entered it once with the help of an enormous amount of power injection (probably with the help of Kruks as well), and never managed to enter again.</p>
<p>Mr. Leng never re-discovered The Many Worlds himself - despite his desperate attempt to stay alive, he only lives longer because of Queen's blessing and that's also why he needs constant treatment in order to stay young with Cyborg technologies (partly developed by Kruks for Tellurians and other human-machine-hybrids), and he only gets a glimpse of the true power before he got Ex Calibre.</p>
<p>Through his effort in discovering methods of living eternally (probably more convinced so after he hearing about Xirams from Kruks), he obtained the information from ancient Medalian books that heirs of the Queen runs blood of the Queen, and potentially contains traces of Ex Calibre. Since then (which was quite early) he started making this “essence extracting device” (probably with the help of Kruks) to extract such alixir from Zhang He.
Using this anecdotal method he successfully gets and drinks the Ex Calibre he extracted from Zhang He and obtained the ever-more-powerful ability to interface and extract energy directly from The Many Worlds (he never knew The Many Worlds was just part of the Portkey and it was just part of the power Portkey can offer) - which he himself considers as the legendary “meta-world” as described in 道教玄学 books found on Tellus.</p>
<p>This new-found power gave Mr. Leng quite some devastating matter-transforming capabilities - it’ a <strong>different kind from the sort of quantum-energy elemental magic that we have in this world</strong>: it’s a power of raw, brute force, capable of destruction, BUT it’s not sufficient for creation, for this reason Mr. Leng still needs constant medical treatments, though he himself might be capable enough to destroy some bad cells and symptoms this way, he can’t make himself fundamentally better. He’s <strong>anxious and angry</strong> by this fact.</p>
<p>What is given can also be taken back, later Kun VI took it back as a punishment for abusing such power.</p>
<h2 id="service-to-kun-vii">Service to Kun VII</h2>
<h2 id="the-road-to-in-nfc">The Road to 神化 in NFC</h2>
<p>The training led Mr. Leng to be able to traverse through time and history through mentality across the local universe (aka. Earth or the Solar system) to some quite far-stretched time lines. Mr. Leng met The Contractor (the dealer, the broker, an ancient indian who speaks Arabic) while he's travelling in 太乙迥境, with who he strike a deal to bring back Qianqiuye Jundai, the requirements were: 1) A dead person into a period where it didn't exist; 2) In exchange, a physical experience memory recollected since the contractor doesn't have a body. The delivery was made to the Portkey, which The Contractor is aware of and has access to. <!--(Remark) Most likely 祝西城 had a similar deal when replacing saving his life and replacing 张老爷's dick. --> <!--(Remark, Writing) The key in the writing or depiction of this is NOT to just mention the skill, but to talk about **specific information/details**, e.g. if Leng was able to travel to the past, then what additional interpretations/details that he can observe based on a more intimate relationship with the situation? Like how 寻秦记 adds additional (unnecessary but fun) interpretations to historical events - **a reinterpretation of history**. In other cases, if Mr. Leng has access to all sorts of things happening around him, then when he is actively making an observation, he should be invincible. Unless, of course, the trap in 太乙迥境 means he was there only once, into a specific time period, and never again could he freely enter that level. --></p>
<h2 id="goal-on-tellus">Goal on Tellus</h2>
<p>Portkey requires tremendous amount of power to operate, and even so only momentarily. The original shrine was a power house; Later first queen completely mastered the secrets of the Portkey and magnified this fact by adding the energy barrier to accessing it - pretending this device needs charging.
Kun VII brought the device with her when she left Kai. Mr. Leng always wanted to help build <strong>Dyson Sphere</strong> for the Tellus because he desperately wants more - he used to be able to use that nuclear fusion power to momentarily power the device.</p>
<h2 id="seeking-longevity">Seeking Longevity</h2>
<p>Maybe a bigger issue for him is: without her (Kun), he's getting older quick. Despite his power, a mortal cannot deny fate. Maybe not in terms of appearance, since Miah people can be trained in that, but physiological capabilities, he's degrading. How evident? Should we somehow depict this chance of motor skills? Of just misc health issue? E.g. Used to drink cold water now must be very careful. （倒像是我自己的慢性病）</p>
<h2 id="deprecated-habbitroutine">(Deprecated) Habbit/Routine</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Leng Xiansheng, Bai Zhan) Leng Xiansheng needs to do a medical examination every months or three months. That's one of the few chances he will leave the house. Bai Zhan will be accompanying him, but in fact she's doing the examination as well. The fact is, it's not simple medical examination, and it took way longer than something like a teeth examination - it's brain examination. During this time they need to make sure the materials are not deteriorating and everything is functioning correctly. See discussion on <strong>Wireless Brain Control Technology</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="routine">Routine</h2>
<ul>
<li>跟千秋叶一年见一次<!--The relationship is very very likely sexual-->，其余时候用书信联系。(idea from) For a good, solid, trusting relationship, once per a long time (相见如故) is beautiful.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="habitat">Habitat</h2>
<p>冷先胜的书房很大，200平方英尺（这个单位是不是不太符合文化？）、很空旷，只有一张桌子。榻榻米下面摆放了书籍等用品。<!--(Inspiration, Idea from) 在家呆着其实很伤、而且不利于工作，没有效率可言，去公司、学校等更有利于专注。一个原因可能是，大学比公司还要大上太多了吧。--></p>
<h2 id="illicit-offspring-adopting-catherine">Illicit Offspring &amp;&amp; Adopting Catherine</h2>
<p>Lots of (potential) trouble that Mr. Leng had against the entire Medala system/law is he had a child with Kun VII - that's strictly forbidden by the regulations of Queens.</p>
<!--张鹤和雪映可以是同一天出生，这样比较方便。-->
<p>Mr. Leng used to try to teach Catherine, when he (momentarily) felt affectionate and &quot;want to do some good&quot; (as all parents sometimes do). Once he tried to reach her the way of perceiving a different world (in this universe, see below for Alternative Worlds), requiring her to calm down and try to meditate and feel the vibration of the universe, and even to practice this everyday. May or may not be at that time Catherine was going through her puberty, so respectful as she was to her father, and even though she has been practicing some of his arts for a long time (only secretly? Because he's not willing to teach?) - she can’t resist a bit resentment to him.</p>
<h2 id="managing-zhang-he">Managing Zhang He</h2>
<p>Mr. Leng’s attention to Catherine is like a camouflage - when Mr. Leng and Zhang He were alone he tried to teach me (him?). But of course Zhang He was irritable towards Mr. Leng: &quot;what is the evidence that the things you mentioned even exist?!&quot; &quot;Evidence? It's right here! Light is the evidence - when objects move at relativistic velocities they shrink to become flat. Light are such objects that are moving so fast they literally become pure energies that light up our world!&quot;.</p>
<p>Before Zhang He leaves CofN when he had a fight with Catherine. Mr. Leng get the news and asked him back for a talk because he deemed it necessary before he leaves. However that wasn't easy given that their relationship at that time was already not good. Then it happens as described above. During that time, Zhang He asked: &quot;then show me&quot;&quot;I can't&quot;&quot;then how do you know it's true&quot;&quot;because I have seen it, if you just allow yourself to calm down and follow my instructions I might be able to show you as well&quot;&quot;it's just your hallucination, how do you know that world even exists, how do you know it's not just your own made up syories&quot;&quot;it is a manifest of our minds, and indeed we could have done it in many ways, but some are different than others, some are more ????(superior) and guides us towards the gate of another world, but you got to follow what is true rather than get confused by your own bias. When you shall do that, you will be able to achieve much more, and even affect this reality.&quot;&quot;yet you don't have a proof&quot;&quot;I cannot show you&quot;&quot;enough bullshit, I am leaving&quot;&quot;I know you have it in you, no matter what you do, remember my words, ....&quot;&quot;I don't know why you summoned me here and not Catherine. Is she involved in all these?&quot;&quot;you are not an ordinary man, you mustnt let what you seen confuse you...&quot;</p>
