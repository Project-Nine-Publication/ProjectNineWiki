<li><strong>Full Name</strong>: Vasilis Korovin</li>
<li><strong>Occupation/Titles</strong>:
<ul>
<li><em>The Magician</em> / <em>Mar</em> / <em>The Charodey</em></li>
<li>High Master at the <strong>Order of the Magisters</strong> (practitioner of <strong>astra</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Birthplace</strong>: Iluran city, in the Kingdom of Drakken</li>
<li><strong>Age</strong>: 48</li>
<li><strong>Society/Affiliation</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Order of the Magisters</strong> (a key institution for those skilled in astral arts)</li>
<li>Once aligned to Eldoria’s defense, though born under Drakken rule.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="appearancephysical-traits">Appearance/Physical Traits</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tall, thin</strong> build</li>
<li><strong>Pale blue skin</strong> (typical of Eldorian mars, though his origins are in Drakken)</li>
<li>Usually seen in <strong>tattered magister robes</strong> bearing Eldoria’s sigils (which he sometimes hides beneath plainer garments).</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="personality-motivations">Personality &amp; Motivations</h2>
<!-- Vasilis maintains unflinching composure in the face of crisis, serving as both a dedicated mentor and shrewd strategist. He values preserving knowledge, relics, and survivors above all else—often placing the greater good before personal honor. This pragmatic approach leads him to make choices that appear traitorous, such as publicly shattering a sacred statue to bargain with Drakken forces, but he does so to protect what remains of Eldoria’s legacy. Though each sacrifice weighs heavily on his conscience, he accepts the moral burden if it means safeguarding culture and life in a world torn by war. -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Calm and Commanding</strong>: Maintains composure in dire circumstances.</li>
<li><strong>Dedicated Mentor and Strategist</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Guided young mars (mages) like <strong>Ferin</strong> (Chapter 1) and <strong>Kalara</strong> (Chapter 2).</li>
<li>Believes preserving knowledge, relics, and survivors is paramount—sometimes over direct confrontation in a losing battle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>High Moral Stakes, Pragmatic Action</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Will appear “traitorous” if it allows him to protect crucial relics or secure better odds for allies.</li>
<li>Values survival of culture and memory over vain heroics, though he regrets each sacrifice deeply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Protector of Eldorian (and Allied) Legacies</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Strives to preserve relics, historical ties, and magical traditions that the Drakken seek to destroy.</li>
<li>Will risk his own reputation (and even appear traitorous) if it means safeguarding an artifact or giving survivors a chance to escape.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="magical-abilities">Magical Abilities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staff from Alhamra’s Sacred Tree</strong>: A fragment of the fabled Alhamra, once used to strengthen Eldoria’s wards.</li>
<li><strong>Pragmatic Spellcraft</strong>: Able to cast both offensive bolts (as seen during fights) and illusions or barriers. Skilled enough to appear non-threatening while hiding formidable power.</li>
</ul>
<p>These effects are limited to the durability of the relics he carries and require precise knowledge of the rune’s incantation. The practice of rune-based magic would be an art in itself, dependent on hard-to-obtain relics and perhaps even relic repair or crafting, lending an air of rarity and reverence to his abilities.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Thread of Fate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A rare, subtle power letting him sense possible futures or outcomes.</li>
<li>Allows him to anticipate threats, avert disasters, or guide allies toward safer paths.</li>
<li>Requires deep focus and used sparingly, making his insights all the more potent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Veil of Silence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A concealment art that masks his presence or intentions from both mundane and magical scrutiny.</li>
<li>Not true invisibility, but an ability that makes him effectively “overlooked” or unremarkable, enabling covert operations and safe passage.</li>
<li>Particularly useful when maneuvering behind enemy lines or meeting contacts in secret.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sigil of Warding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rune-based magic channeled via relics inscribed with ancient symbols.</li>
<li>Creates <strong>temporary protective barriers</strong> or mild <strong>elemental effects</strong> (e.g., small gusts of wind, localized warmth) when activated, as long as the relic is maintained.</li>
<li>Useful in the old cold weapon and magic times but is less effective against the irons of Drakken soldiers. Limited by the relic’s integrity and the precision of the rune’s incantation, rendering it less effective against the Drakken’s advanced iron weaponry.</li>
<li>Emphasizes Vasilis’s scholarly background: mastery of runes, relic crafting/repair, and the meticulous study required to wield such magic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Vasilis is otherwise old and not super good in terms of physical body strength.</p>
<h2 id="background-notable-events">Background &amp; Notable Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Origins in Drakken Territory</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Born in Iluran city, he was exposed early to the empire’s ironclad doctrines.</li>
<li>Eventually became part of the <strong>Order of the Magisters</strong>, devoting himself to astral arts that the Drakken regime largely mistrusted or suppressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Service in Eldoria</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rose to prominence as a <strong>High Master</strong> within the Order, mentoring younger mages and fortifying Eldoria’s magical defenses.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Secret Exchange &amp; Capture</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>Chapter 2</strong>, met covertly with <strong>Kalara</strong> (a former pupil serving in the Drakken forces) to pass on a vital relic—“the Heart of the Eternal Flame.”</li>
<li>Helped <strong>Queen Nymeria</strong> of Alda’s attempted escape from besieged Alhamra, ultimately captured by Drakken patrols.</li>
<li>Publicly shattered a sacred statue to bargain for an audience with Emperor Vulkan—provoking accusations of betrayal but aiming to protect the few remaining legacies of Eldoria and Alda.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strengths-weaknesses">Strengths &amp; Weaknesses</h2>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arcane Mastery</strong>: Skilled in subtle and defensive magic, with keen foresight via the Thread of Fate.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive &amp; Diplomatic</strong>: Will negotiate, feign submission, or broker deals if it can secure others’ survival and preserve knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Steadfast Compassion</strong>: Continues to value life and hope despite the relentless devastation around him.</li>
</ul>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical Frailty</strong>: Not strong in hand-to-hand combat or prolonged physical exertion; relies heavily on magic and cunning.</li>
<li><strong>Burden of Conscience</strong>: Shoulders guilt for decisions that appear traitorous, risking trust from allies (e.g., Queen Nymeria’s condemnation).</li>
<li><strong>Reliance on Rare Relics</strong>: Much of his warding and rune magic depends on specialized relics, which can be lost or damaged.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="legacy-impact">Legacy &amp; Impact</h2>
<p>Vasilis Korovin’s story underscores a crucial pivot point in the war-torn history of <strong>Tellus</strong>. Whether regarded as a hero working behind enemy lines or branded a traitor for striking pacts with the Drakken, his ultimate aim remains the same: to <strong>preserve</strong> what he can of Eldoria’s—and other threatened kingdoms’—cultural and magical heritage. Through his unique gifts and willingness to take calculated risks, Vasilis stands as a testament that sometimes <strong>knowledge, subtlety, and survival</strong> can triumph where raw force cannot.</p>
<h2 id="key-actions-developments">Key Actions &amp; Developments</h2>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Prisoner in Stahlmere</strong></p>

</ol>
<p>Overall Character Arc: Vasilis Korovin represents the <strong>bridge between survival and hope</strong>. In a world ravaged by war, he repeatedly chooses the path of <em>subtlety, foresight, and self-sacrifice</em> over direct confrontation. His calm exterior masks deep sorrow and determination, and although viewed as a “traitor” by some, he remains steadfast in his mission to preserve Eldoria’s legacy (and that of other threatened kingdoms) at all costs.</p>
