<h2 id="early-life-and-education">Early Life and Education</h2>
<p>Li Wenhao was born in the coastal city of Qingdao, Shandong Province, during the tail end of the Cultural Revolution. Raised in a household of educators—his father a physics teacher and his mother a librarian—Li showed an early fascination with logic puzzles and foreign technology magazines smuggled through seafarers' trade routes.</p>
<p>He enrolled in <strong>Tsinghua University</strong> in 1985, where he earned his B.Sc. in Computer Science and later completed his Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in 1993. During his postgraduate years, Li was a visiting scholar at the <strong>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</strong>, where he was exposed to early web protocols and academic mailing lists. This exposure became pivotal in shaping his later ideas around information indexing and global knowledge accessibility.</p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<h3 id="founding-of-haoyang-1994">Founding of Haoyang (1994)</h3>
<p>While lecturing at Tsinghua, Li collaborated with Chen Yujing, a former investigative journalist and fellow advocate for open knowledge. The two launched <strong>HY Bulletin (浩阳布告栏)</strong>, an internal digital board system for student discussions and class notes, inspired by Usenet and early BBS systems.</p>
<p>In 1997, the project spun off as a private company — <strong>Haoyang Technologies, Inc.</strong> — with Li as Chief Architect and Chairman. His design for the <strong>Haoyang Index</strong> emphasized not just searchability, but emotional and contextual understanding, blending manual curation with algorithmic recommendations — a hybrid approach that gained early popularity in Asia.</p>
<h3 id="digital-spring-and-soft-globalism">Digital Spring and Soft Globalism</h3>
<p>From 1999 to 2009, Li oversaw Haoyang’s rise during the “Digital Spring,” advocating for what he called <strong>“Soft Globalism”</strong> — a strategy of respectful, non-disruptive expansion into developing markets through language localization, ethical data practices, and emotional UX.</p>
<p>He was instrumental in establishing the <strong>Brand Harmony Index</strong> (a user-facing quality score for content and ads) and pushed for cross-cultural training programs in Haoyang's R&amp;D centers, particularly in Nairobi and Jakarta.</p>
<h3 id="the-qiming-era-and-ethical-ai-2015present">The Qiming Era and Ethical AI (2015–present)</h3>
<p>With the launch of Haoyang’s AI division in 2015, Li transitioned from CEO to <strong>Chief Visionary Officer (CVO)</strong>. He led the creation of <strong>Qiming (启明)</strong> — a sentiment-aware AI platform — and introduced internal AI ethics charters still referenced in global policy discussions.</p>
<p>Following criticism during the “Sunlight Manipulation” scandal in 2024, Li appeared publicly for the first time in years to address transparency concerns. His speech at the <strong>Everything Good Summit 2025</strong>, titled <em>“Algorithmic Kindness,”</em> is widely credited with reshaping public discourse on digital mood engineering.</p>
<h2 id="influence-and-legacy">Influence and Legacy</h2>
<p>Li Wenhao is frequently cited as one of the founding figures of the <strong>East Asian Digital Renaissance</strong>, alongside figures like Masato Kuroda (Wakabayashi Index) and Nawal Sharif (PanAfricaNet). His model of <strong>“Emotionally Intelligent Computing”</strong> has been incorporated into university curricula and global tech ethics frameworks.</p>
<p>He is known for rejecting the “move fast and break things” ethos, advocating instead for <strong>slow, harmonious growth</strong>, and <strong>interface optimism</strong> — the belief that technology interfaces can psychologically uplift users.</p>
<h2 id="awards-and-honors">Awards and Honors</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital Harmony Prize</strong>, United Nations Tech-Ethics Council (2022)</li>
<li><strong>Turing East Award</strong>, Asia-Pacific Computing Society (2023)</li>
<li><strong>World Information Architecture Fellowship</strong>, Geneva Institute (2024)</li>
<li>Featured in <em>Time Alt-World 100</em>, 2025</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal Life</h2>
<p>A known introvert, Li is rarely seen in public outside Haoyang summits and academic panels. He is an avid <strong>Go player</strong>, publishes essays under the pseudonym <em>&quot;SunBehindClouds&quot;</em> (云后日), and maintains a personal archive of calligraphy from Song dynasty scholars.</p>
<p>Li lives in a minimalist compound in Chengdu designed by Japanese architect Morihiro Senda and rarely travels outside Asia.</p>
