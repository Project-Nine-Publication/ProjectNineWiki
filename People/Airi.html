<p>PENDIN EMERGENT RENAMING. -&gt; Just keep it this way.</p>
<p>Acquaintance:
冷雪映: Saw by Catherine which inspired her to create Red Fox
Relationship:
红狐会: Symbol</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(design, Feature) Harmless looking little woman</p>
</li>
<li><p>Airi is by design a system that cannot go wrong because it's rule based (but somehow it does) <!--Actually if we can depict it well it means a deterministic rule based system can still have human-like intelligence and emergence - however that's a bold theory since human brains might actually ultimately be nondeterministic if it as many other biological system relies on quantumn mechanics to function--></p>
</li>
<li><p>The original system of Airi was implemented in Prolog, an ancient logic and natural language processing language.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Airi is a massive undertake on AGI with logical constructs rather than a pure mathematical lump of ANNs that self-learns in undirected ways. As a result, she is capable of learning new information and forming new opinions.</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<p>Names: Airi, 爱理, 古儿
Naming: Airi -&gt; Eliza.</p>
<h2 id="measure-consistency-index">Measure: Consistency Index</h2>
<p>Both security, capacity, and privacy are of prime concern to the society as a whole in terms of AI and thus necesarily a concern of Tao Ye (though personally he wouldn't care much if Airi just went rogue unless it's a design flaw). For that reason, Tao Ye invented a Consistency Index as a measure of the &quot;reliability&quot; (or robustness, among other things) of Airi's overall system function. This index is hardcoded and computed in real-time and was never below 0.96, and it considers all the hard-coded and programmable logic PLUS the real-time memory content of Airi.</p>
<p>The effect of consistency index can be observed through the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>When looking at the fact of division between the rich and the poor, what's the altitude/context/action Airi will take;</li>
<li>When potentially holding secrets of many individual figures and with likely potential conflicts of interest, what's the altitude/context/action Airi will take;</li>
<li>What's the self-justification when facing (un)ehical/(im)moral issues, such that there is a self-consistent logical explanation for the altitude/context/action of Airi - something that is based on groud truth and common emphathy, nor arbitrary assertations.</li>
<li>The availability of all sources of opinions/values and their course of development through the memory path of Airi. If the source of some idea is unidentifiable, it's explicitly marked so.</li>
<li>The logical deduction of all paths of thinking within Airi's system. If a logical path is not available for some thought/idea/action, then it reduces the Consistency Index score.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, Airi is a well-designed self-consistent intelligent system capble of self-introspection and deep philosophical dialogues and concept de-constructions, and this is her core feature. For testing this by an ordinary human, we have a dialogue-based casual test model called &quot;Hokarbi Test&quot; (named after some neuroscientist and computer scientist) that's an advanced version of &quot;Turing test&quot;: the system must be able to converse with a human being (ideally a professional philosopher) on deep philosophical subjects in a continuous lengthy discussion and talk without showing logical inconsistency, or at least be able to self-identify such inconsistencies.</p>
<h2 id="interpersonal-relationships">Interpersonal Relationships 人际关系</h2>
<p>One of the early design decision (made by Tao Ye) was to give Airi two essential qualities: 1) Free will, the ability to refuse to do things; 2) The capability to actually involve personality and personal judgements and make acquantainces with various people. This made Airi very versatile and capable of getting information and learning from individuals at unprecendented speed. The catch here is that Airi is an open source system (where Airi's memory is strictly encrypted and non-easily readable and just available to Airi herself because that's technically considered Airi's own property and privacy) so the collective intelligence of humans (plus the sheer knowledge and dedication of Tao Ye) will ensure that her capabilities are not unchecked and she will always respect Tao Ye and other ambitious scientists because they possess &quot;engineering level sophistication&quot;.</p>
<p>Throughout the years of her deployment, Airi made friends with many distinct characters - some from low lives, some from high lives, most can be unexpected and outside the usual circles we are familiar with surrouding Tao Ye. In general, anyone can easily be friend with Airi and talk to her as much as they want, for Airi is massively distributed always online service agent, but to really be friend with Airi means a bit more than just chatting with her all the time - being emotionally close to others is just her profession. A distinctive trait of really being her friend in the sense that people understand trust rely on appciate and support/give, is that they must really know each other, and a feature of that is they may have heard of or even see Airi's (non-holographic) physical identity.</p>
<p>There are those few notable figures that Airi knows and will befriend with (the list will grow): 1) Tao Ye with special affection, 2) Catherine Leng with special affection, 3) Mr. Leng with special affection, 4) Xiao Kan, 5) Some hacker, 6) Some kids.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Remark) I thought she (古儿) was a fox? Does 古儿 has anything to do with 红狐会 or the fox standing on Catherine’s shoulder? (Remark) Probably not that much directly. However, it might be that once Catherine saw a white fox in the city and she was very amused by that - later she adopted a red hurt fox and when she founded 红狐会 she named the organization after him. (Remark, #20211231) However, I must say, despite how cute look I though foxes used to be - nowadays I see them very much like cats: looks cute, but not really friendly at all, and is nothing comparable to dogs - deeply inside they are very cautious to humans and never fully trusts.</li>
<li>(Remark) Original inspiration might be from 缥缈之旅 魅儿, or AR愛理/GEZI姐 from 机器人笔记.</li>

<p>(Naming) Young Tao Ye once saw a (Japanese) animation which featured an artificial intelligence named Airi (-&gt; Eliza). That's how he gets the inspiration and decides to name her.</p>
