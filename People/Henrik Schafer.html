<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<ul>
<li>I don't want him to sound too English-origin. Ideally German origin. Henrik: A German variation of &quot;Henry,&quot; maintaining a connection to his ancestor. Schäfer: Meaning &quot;shepherd&quot; in German, subtly nodding to his role as a missionary or spiritual guide. Alternative last name: <code>Kastner</code>, A German surname that feels modern yet has historical depth, tying to trades like &quot;chest maker.&quot;</li>
