<p>There's nothing more boring than watching someone else play a RPG! So let's also be (aka. using our name) a small insignificant role in this novel.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- I like it. This can be a self-contained small isolated piece that do not have much to do at all with the overarching concept of P9 and the Simulatione universe. -->
<ul>
<li>(Charles, concept, design, robot restaurant) Charles manages a robot restaurant where he hires humans to act. The whole restaurant is (appears to be) operated by automated machines and robots, and it serves <em>Japanese style sushi and noodles</em> (notice preparation of raw material doesn't need to be handled by robots at all, even if the kitchen is not open to public).</li>
<li>Upon entering the room the most salient aspect is the bar tender who is a robot (much like that movie where a single man wake up). The food tray is a rotating food style and bar tender mostly responsible for asking people to put their dishes on the tray for recycling and serving drinks. All servants are robots, including human like and non human like cleaning robots.</li>
<li>(Training) Employees will look through a screen and send messages to be synthesized to voice by typing. A natural delay is thus present. There is strict training and systematic responses much like for a regular phone answerer in banks etc. (Quote) &quot;If you keep bothering me like this, I will call a human to kick you out.&quot; &quot;Hi, how may I help you.&quot;</li>
<li>(Plot) You think it's a robot restaurant run by humans? Because you see job postings hiring human actors? What if those hired humans are actually running a simulation through their B/W screen that they think they are watching through robots camera eyes, while Airi is actually responsible for interacting with humans, and synthesizing those realistic videos for human operators? (Design, plot) They hire new operator every month so as to avoid people remembering all possible premade dialogues (while in fact trying to avoid people abnormality in the video) - dialogues are usually auto-suggested. They are free to type anything when they think is more appropriate (which will of course not be used but merely as training material for Airi).</li>
<li>(Legend, Airi) There is rumor Charles' Robot Restaurant is run by Charles Huang <!--(Remark, #20230614) At that time I meant the character now named Tao Ye - who will in the future be further renamed; It made sense to make this "myth" because both this fictional character Charles Zhang and Tao Ye had the same "Charles" as English name; However, when we change the name of Tao Ye further, this 谐音-like incident may no longer apply-->, Charles ???, Charles ??? (Many other important people named Charles in the city), others say it's run by a superior AI system developed by ??? company. Others claim there is nothing special about it because some conversations are quite mundane. However no one actually knows who owns it because that is not public - they either secretly operates this business, or through other means, but all legal actions are handled through this robot 傀儡 Charles: Charles TBT is a legally registered citizen capable of handling a wide variety of business operations and related stuff through his underlying system, which is not open source but runs its own infrastructure and network (some code on COP but private), and only the data transmission interface is connected to COP through general public ports. (Legal, policy, technology, COP) Notice even though all important social functions are online through COP, custom solutions for exist and have their specific cases to be more efficient and there is necessity for them to exist. Thus it's not uncommon to see machines or programs that have specialized hardwares and software systems. It's just one way or another since there is not allowed to build middlewares serving public information (I.e. all information accessible to public should be hold on public platform I.e. COP),most contents are through COP and usually unless for highly customized solutions people won't bother building their own infrastructure. (Plot) naturally a way to inspect this machinery was to inspect the manufacturers and track transportation and transaction log, but since this device is as currently used/occupied by Charles TBT people can't do that, and since it's just more fun and less important, people don't bother doing that. (Plot, Airi, 古儿, R19) Charles' Robot Restaurant (CRR) is thus one of many Airi's experimental 化身 - unlike what 古儿 speculate or what Airi's morph in Silicon Valley shows, those are merely aspects with specially tuned characteristics for Airi. Underneath all of it is a central data bus that somehow (of course not through COP; Might be sharing some networks with R19 - yes you might think R19 is solely sponsored by Mr. Leng and unknown to Charles, but you never know) feed to the mother of it all - ?????. ¶(Name) <strong>Charles' Robot Restaurant</strong>, bar tenders name is Charles. (Character) Charles The Bar Tender - the job postings are posted by him. He is a registered legal entity with annual CP contribution. ¶(Design, objective, entity) One objective through this description is to provide a complete picture of a feasible implementation of this robot restaurant idea so real world might be able to make use of it. (Research) See anywhere in world whether people already have implemented thus and how they handle specific things. (Production, request for rendering, practice) Do a render or filmic animation show a conversation of the bar tender with people, show basic construction of the screen.(Idea, layout) A description of restaurant layout... (Reference mostly per impression of Umbrella Academic donut shop) (有图为证) B/W: &quot;Charles' Robot Restaurant at ???, D7, Enfan City&quot;
<ul>
<li>(restaurant) <strong>Charles' Robot Restaurant</strong>: bar tenders name is <strong>Charles</strong>, no last name. ¶This restaurant is a place where Charles Huang (Tao Ye) might like to visit - if Charles Huang (Tao Ye) is the architect. But per latest idea (per 20210222), that main character (who is familiar with Mr Leng and Leng Xue Ying) will not be called &quot;Charles Huang&quot; - if that's the case, and if there is still a Charles Huang in the story. Then that Charles Huang can be mechanic, who is married (with a girl named Jessie?) and started this restaurant as a family business, and appropriately named the robot &quot;Charles&quot;. (If this shall be a latent story, i.e. many years after Xiao Kan came back from the outer space, then the owner of the restaurant can be a guy who married that AI girl who was abused and saved by Xiao Kan)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(design) The floor is diamond-shaped grid B/W tile, the seats are (synthetic) leather, two rows facing each others as a group. There are 3 to 4 columns of seats, each with 4 such small booths. The surrondings are glasses, the walls are just slightly taller than the seats. In general the space is quite spacious and bright, sitting in the corner of a traffic crossing that's not that busy. The operating hour of the restaurant is from 6 am to 4 am. Thrice a day some children will come do the cleaning. There is a washroom near the kitchen door. A homeless guy lives nears the seat there - the booth is always with a wooden sign &quot;Occupied&quot; on the table when he's absent. No one seems to bother much. Occasionally when there is an uproad, or someone didn't pickup his order for too long and Charles repeats a second time his name, the homeless would stand up and get his meal for him. ¶Usually when there are more than 10 tables occupied the system will stop taking new orders untill the number drops to 8. There are two speakers hang up in the wall behind Charles, those serve as his way of communication. Customers can order either while speaking to Charles or directly through the touch screeen near the entrance or at the bar. There is a giant TV after Charles - no usual bar stuff. The desk in front of Charles is a transmission belt, two ends leading back to the kitchen. After someone made an order he will be seated and someone from the kitchen will prepare the food well, put on the belt and Charles will annouce the name of the customer. This opens up some friendly pranks for those who enter their names through the touch screen. You can hear funny things like &quot;...&quot; sometimes. Surprisingly, either the names are censored or people are just friendly in general, Xiao Kan never heard of any otherwise inappropriate names. Charles the bar tender has very realistic looking upper body, well dressed in suits and always look sharp. His movement is very limited - the most it can do is to rotate, to fake some hand movement typing on a fake keyboard when someone make an order, and to point to the food someone ordered from the transmission belt. ¶&quot;I heard rumors that someone heard people talking behind that.&quot; ... ¶ (While Xiao Kan was chatting with Charles at the Bar, a tall lady came from behind) &quot;Don't get fooled by his blant appearance. This bad guy sleeps with young ladys after work.&quot; &quot;Never! How can you say something like that to our gentleman Charles?&quot; &quot;Well, how do you explain the underwear found in the garden? It can't be growing with the tomatoes?&quot; &quot;Not if it's red.&quot; ... &quot;Time to go, the make-up artist will come soon.&quot; ... &quot;Charles, give me a bottle of bear, with some salted penuts.&quot; &quot;Are you two supposed to be working in the kitchen?&quot; &quot;No? What made you think of that? It's automatic - r-o-b-o-t-i-c, you see.&quot; &quot;Our restaurant could use some little mystery.&quot; ¶ (Legend) The fact with this place might be that the kitchen in the back is actually highly automated. Neither Charles nor Jessie took care of the restaurant nor the garden - the make up artist does the most for the appearance of the place, the cleaning kids does all the surface work, and the supply lady handles replacing things or notify repairers when things are not working. Very likely there will be a garden guy who took care of the garden. Then the supply company will take care of re-fill the kitchen - those people might actually know and see what's behind the scene. Basically, once Charles set up the whole process, the system just works all by itself. Customers will have to take the dishes, make the orders and put back the finished dishes all by themselves.</li>
