<p>Allegiance/Faith/Master: Krovinos (after fall of Drakken)</p>
<p>The Dravens were once minor nobility or wealthy landowners in Daralon, influential enough to hold sway locally in Liora. When Drakken took over, the Draven family faced a choice: resist and lose everything, or integrate and secure their standing. The Dravens decided to integrate, becoming one of the few Daralonese families to thrive under Drakken rule. This decision have earned them a reputation as collaborators among other Daralonese families, though they have also taken calculated risks to protect their heritage and resources. Because of their divided allegiances, Callun’s parents have walked a fine line, privately preserving the values and history of Daralon while outwardly supporting Drakken's regime. They have served as intermediaries between the old Daralonese aristocracy and the Drakken conquerors.</p>
<p>Known as keepers of knowledge or lore from Daralon, the Draven family have had a tradition of educating themselves in both the histories of Daralon and Drakken, bridging the cultures. This background make Callun’s role as information minister fitting, as he grew up in a family that valued history, narratives, and records.</p>
<p>The Dravens have harbored some religious beliefs tied to Daralon’s old traditions, with traces of these beliefs lingering. Callun’s shift to evangelizing Krovinos would be seen as a dramatic but symbolic break from his family’s past, as Krovinos represents both destruction and rebirth - a powerful, almost allegorical shift from Daralon to Drakken.</p>
