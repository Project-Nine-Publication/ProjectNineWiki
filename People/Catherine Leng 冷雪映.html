<p>(We had an audio recording on Catherine's life, pending transcription; It's 20230623)</p>
<p>生日：二月17日</p>
<p>冷先胜之女，母亲？？？（冷先胜和雪映从小如何相处，其实是个很好的问题、而关于母亲的身份，这也是个雪映自然会经常疑惑的事情；但是没有母亲的照顾，使得雪映从小多一些刚柔——但是雪映的柔软层面总是还需要有人来学习的，该是从母亲的身上？）</p>
<p>Passionate, bold yet delicate, full of action.</p>
<p>Born on July 25th, 2016, Catherine was the apparent child Mr. Leng until year 2045 (age 29) when Kun asked Mr. Leng to leave earth with him at which time Zhang He's true identity become apparent. She's also the official inheriter or future manager of the city (as declared per the <strong>Cityzenship Consensus</strong> regarding the true ownership of the city). She's a child with no parents yet possession very positive and hopeful character, however, the early 5 years in child labour caused some initial somewhat isolated personality due to the misfortune. Mr. Leng adopted her from the <em>Christian Orphanage Charity</em> in Toronto in 2025 (age 9), or in fact, a <em>foster care</em> parent. Catherine's biological parents (<strong>Noah Schmidt</strong> and <strong>Lina Fischer</strong>) are both dead in a car crash, and her grandfather, <strong>Leon Schmidt</strong> was the owner of multi-billion national coorporation car manufacturer <strong>Chauvi</strong> and grandma's identity unknown. Her living relatives include both (fact: 80% of orphans have at least one living relative and grandparents are usually live) those living in German and those in Toronto. By no means is Catherine's background &quot;clear&quot; of those human attachments, and as such her personal live does involve those frequent visits both to and from those relative, and many friends alike especially since she's actually a big figure.</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<p>(NAME WILL NEED CHANGE - ALL OF THEM, SINCE THE MIGRATION TO THE CONTEXT OF TELLUS)</p>
<p>Names: Leng Xueying, 冷雪映, Catherine Leng
原名张雪莹；“雪映”这个名字确实梦境原生，也来的早于“张雪莹”的mention
(idea from) 那个轿车里面一对少年男女的模样、以及梦中“雪の映画“字眼</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Originally known and fixated as &quot;冷雪映&quot;, and in English that would be &quot;Leng Xueying&quot; with a potential local &quot;english name&quot; &quot;Catherine&quot; - which we never liked. Now we are moving from Earth to Tellus, all those will change - one the highest abstraction level, the thing I love most about her original name &quot;冷雪映&quot; is the mechanism of combination of various <em>feelings + objeects + effects</em> - words that are ordinarily used in a real language - being used to form a name, that refers to a girl.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As the character goes, per original and later modified background, she's originally a &quot;European&quot;/&quot;western&quot; born (nonthless on Tellus), and end up becoming an adopted daughter (who wants to be a boy) of her father. The laterly adopted name, if given by the adopted father, would <em>reflect the cultural origin of NFC</em> - a Chinnan-migrated city in the new-found immigration continent/country of XXX, with a diverse and western/eastern hybrid culture. Since her father would be a fan of ancient Chinnan culture, it's OK for this character's name to follow a Chinnan convention: 2-3 YY glyphs. (Remark, #20241103) Was she re-adopted by Mr. Leng?</p>
</li>
<li><p>冷雪映 -&gt; Lychellri (localization) -&gt; Li5xu5yi2</p>
</li>
<li><p>称呼和昵称：冷（家）大小姐，不使用“冷小姐”（涉及”小姐“的称呼在[[千秋叶君代]]身上比较好听些），小姐（家里人），雪映（长辈和朋友），？？？（[[张鹤]]），冷姑娘（同辈的礼貌称呼）（以及官方的称呼？）；雪映、冷姑娘（书面，即[[（小说）九层楼志]]）</p>
</li>
<li><p>英文名：Sarah Leng/Ling或者Catherine Lin?  (One design factor of this choice of name is that Catherine is a popular game, which has some nice association to Lin.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>(#Interpersonal, Relationship) 称呼张鹤的母亲为“张姨”</p>
</li>
<li><p>(#Interpersonal, Relationship) Name as appear in Tao Ye's personal diary - Iskra. (Origin) Since very early on, we let her take that role, hence the magical association between Iskra (HXX) and Zarna.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personality">Personality</h2>
<p>Notice personality changes, just very slowly, e.g. cycle period can be around 5 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>（特点）She is the kind of girl that's very easy to get along with as long as you are decent, because of her superior physical understanding and experience. Yet really hard to get close to heart - not because she is not open - she is very kindly welcoming - but because of her mental height when reaching deep things, deep understanding.</li>
<li>(dialogue, collection, Xiao Kan, Catherine Leng) 雪映和<del>萧衎</del>Tao Ye在一起语言上也不似自己平时那么文雅，有时更随意些，偶尔也会像“小女生”般（女孩气息更重）；其他时候，雪映的决策、女性权利、气势，在自己一个人时比较强一些、但主要不在语气和对话而在作风和决定上；雪映寻常但凡与人交流时都还算亲和的</li>
<li>老爷子(冷先胜)一生向来严厉，却最拿雪映没办法——雪映一向规规矩矩、做事一丝不苟，可是每当老爷子批评她时（小时候啦），她总是在笑：想来你知道他是喜欢自己的，如何心里能不开心？但雪映聪慧，一经提醒，下次就能改过（女孩子能有什么过错？）。</li>
<li>因为从小跟父亲长大的缘故，雪映比较独立、性格坚忍、待人和善；即便是白斩这样不待见她的，她也称呼白斩为姐姐，只是不知道为什么她对自己好似有芥蒂。</li>
<li>张鹤的父母待雪映其实不薄。</li>
<li>雪映的生活其实没有挫折，所以她可以有善良的心、待人坦诚、执着带领九层楼追求更高的行为境界，也因此太容易信人，被冷先胜的思想其实左右；没有绝对的是非观（完全不同于萧衎和张鹤，性格强硬，观念深重，评判他人；也不同于艾丽丝，女强人气质）</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="archetype">Archetype</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Contrary to Tao Ye who's more mental, abstract and spiritual. She is the person who dares putting ideas into action - a bridge between the ideal world and the real world. Notable examples are the recreation of Whisper as an &quot;impressionism&quot; (印象派) school after the site being wasted after the war - she heard the old times of that place from Tao Ye and wanted to relive the legends and glorious times when Humans and Medalians were an alliance. She initiated and is still working actively on Euphoria, partly inspired by internal struggles with sexuality. Her creation of the painting &quot;Blank&quot; (albeit as a smaller and personal project) is also a symbol of her 行动力. Public reforms (in educations and all aspects of life) need someone pushing it - ideally someone who's at the right position and with proper powers and resources, and Catherine is such a person. Unlike Tao Ye, who claims to lead a bunch of people in research and religion but ultimately is for his own self-fullfillment (a person who plays with the world), Catherine is the one who always actually cares about others and put the life of her cityzens in front of everything (a person who emphasize and intends to help the world).</p>
</li>
<li><p>(20220528, #New!) As her style goes - if she has the quality of a benign nature, we can shape her like Hanrui (as a concrete impression). One solid idea here is: 佩戴翡翠手镯. The key distinction is when Hanrui wear such necklace it doesn't feel like 中国中年大妈 but a sense of 朝气、灵动。颜色上可以避免传统的碧绿翡翠而是淡蓝（蓝水/晴水）翡翠。From there, we can further devise her style.</p>
</li>
<li><p>(20230804) &quot;Diga&quot;, notably her constract of appearance vs personality. This is for correcting the beauty bias. (In a sense) Beauty is poison of heart (because it containminates our preferences and judgements), not ideal (However, the persuit of beauty MAY have the virtue of help developing good virtues - but honestly per our experience, it's hard to judge how deep and wholistically this penetrates, for beauty seems capable of shaping some nice qualities - e.g. Hanrui handling moving out on her own, but yet at the same time it's obviously not TRUTH in the sense Bible is the true, for it shapes very opinionated and biase personality, e.g. again, as Hanrui is). She's someone looks ok on the appearance, but shines inside. If something is true in the bible sense or systematic sense, it should NOT creates dissonance. For instance if &quot;having money&quot; is &quot;true&quot; goals, then the activity itself shouln't have the power to contaminate people's heart. For instance, I rarely see ??? people doing immoral things - for ??? is true (virtue) (Actually I cannot find examples filling in the blank, from people I know). On the other hand, it's certainly HARD to find those people in today's highly specialized society and cities. Then, no one is perfect.</p>
</li>
<li><p>(20230804) With designer clothing, she has many different and distinct styles that looks very pretty. (idea from) This is in reference to Hanrui's distinct style dressing in wide variety of clothes - sports, swimming, casual, dating, formal, vacation, and outdoor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="childhood">Childhood</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>喜食：黑芝麻汤圆、晶莹雪白、早餐或者午后、不多食因为不健康</p>
</li>
<li><p>爱好：（西式）聆听古典音乐、骑单车</p>
</li>
<li><p>Childhood 1: Catherine Leng's original name was <strong>Ingrid <em>Hannah</em> Schmidt</strong> and kidnapped in 2019 (age of 3) by human traffickers during a trip to Mumbai (India) for child begging then arranged child marriage/adoption preparation (and maybe sexual slave/abuse since she's also exotic, however the care could be possibly more well-rounded than other ordinary girls if a rich person owns her) <!--英莲三岁时被拐子拐走，养到十几岁卖给薛蟠; But why would human trafficker bother raise a child for more than 10 years? Sonuds expensive; Maybe Catherine was just sold as child to poor people; Children may be trafficked for the purposes of adoption, particularly international adoption. Children are sourced from orphanages or kidnapped, or parents may be tricked, cajoled or coerced into relinquishing custody.-->. She's then saved by a Canadian philanthropist and brought to <strong>Christian Orphanage Charity</strong> in year 2024 (age of 8), where she started to take Christian style education and then later adopted by Mr. Leng at age of 9 (2025), when her life experienced true settlement. Mr. Leng immediately sent her to Whisper to receive formal and more in-depth education while at the same time the Leng family was living in the <strong>Courtyard of Turtle Tiled Glass</strong> on F2 in <strong>Brown Gardens</strong> with then Whisper assistant professor Tao Ye on arts and history. Hence is the best 7 years of her life at CofN, living regularly, suffering not from miseries. It's also at this time the child Mr. Leng always (How Zhang He is an important character to her heart returning to normal)..... When Tao Ye finally become a full-time professor and moved to F1 and start teaching at the <strong>Architectural Academy of Whisper</strong> at <em>Lakeshore Road</em> in 2032, Catherine is now a 16 year old fully-grown girl and starts to take responsibilities of the shoulder of Mr. Leng and deal with CofN issues. Since Catherine was adopted as daughter of Mr. Leng, she owns full status of CofN cityzen.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Childhood 2: Born in the rich childhood of German car manufacturer giant, Catherine's early childhood was a happy and enriched one, where she received good prep-education, and the fact that her parents didn't come to find her 3 years after the kidnap finally broke her heart and she finally gave up hope of leaving the mansion of the rich indian governer, only much later to know that both of her parents died in a car accident finding her in India (possibly murdered). She hated her family for the most of her life, and only much later (after age 20) starts to know more and gradually know the truth of her family and that accident long before. Early child labour gave her thin and weak build, though this is largely compensated by the early nourishment and she gradually gain back a healthy body after living in CofN. Such experience shaped her virtues and folstered her hunger for knowledge and reading, gave preamp to her hatery to child abuse and human trafficking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section">幼年</h2>
<p>像每一个正常的女孩，雪映<em>小时候也顽皮、贪玩</em>，充满好奇，但是一来冷先胜管教严格，二来好在冷家条件得天独厚，雪映才能够在这样的优势中<strong>快速成长成熟</strong>。</p>
<ol>
<li>雪映幼年时跟着父亲一起习武念书，没有去接受九层楼内的教育而是在家由父亲亲自教育学习；雪映不是九层楼的公民身份（参见<em>冷家</em>）</li>
<li>雪映从年幼时开始就要学习掌握九层楼内所有大大小小从建设到设计到运营的各种知识和细节，也因此雪映本身对于九层楼各个地点的各种事物往往了如指掌</li>
<li>雪映从小就跟着家里人一起偶尔耕种、食物上自然是素食为主，后来长大后则是提倡保护动物而完全素食
<ul>
<li>这一部分的经历促成了雪映对于基本作物知识的了解</li>
<li>作为生活习惯/兴趣的一部分，冷先胜喜欢种植摆弄些花草，也对于雪映的成长有所影响</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="kindergardenprimary-school">Kindergarden/Primary School</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>雪映小时候又黑又瘦（家里吃素），虽然成绩优异、但为人平和，在学校并不如其他样貌出众的女孩受人欢迎（尤其因为维斯波尔虽然有班级但是并无什么特别个人central的班干部概念）。雪映从小深识这个世界、女子的容貌就是一种Asset。</p>
</li>
<li><p>雪映-C10：有事就问老师、老师就是父亲。(Comment, #20230818) Migrated from earlier misc. note, honestly I don't get the meaning of the second part.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="brief-orphanage">(Brief) Orphanage</h2>
<p>(PENDING)</p>
<h2 id="junior-high-school">Junior High School</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Growth, #Deprecating) 自幼无母，虽然张姨对待自己挺好，但是冷先胜似乎不喜欢自己与“平常家”的人（非冷家人）相处太近。（这一部分是雪映性格和成长的''重要契机''——具体development演绎待深化）</li>
<li>(Hobby) 最喜姜夔的词：长亭怨慢  杏花天影，很有种空灵的感觉 (Reference) 参考其《白石道人诗集》《白石道人歌曲》《续书谱》《绛帖平》</li>
<li>(Relationship) 雪映比较能够放的开的时候还是与叔叔Tao Ye一起时</li>
<li>(#Deprecated) 小时候也好奇和问过几次冷先胜关于母亲的事情，但是经历并不愉快，后来就学会了闭嘴；值得一提的是[[Tao Ye]]本人也并不完全知道雪映身世的原委，只是多少怀疑雪映并非是冷先胜亲生（因为Tao Ye早年跟冷先胜一起时并不见到有子、倒是怀疑珺胤是冷先胜的女儿，冷先胜与珺生下张鹤则是隐秘、只有几个圈内的人知道例如白斩）</li>
<li>(Event)（冷雪映视角）父亲的书房里没什么书，但是<strong>剑</strong>倒是有不少。雪映小时候曾经折碎过一把形如枯木的剑（<strong>画影</strong>），因此被父亲罚不许吃肉三个月。</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nfc-construction-period">NFC Construction Period</h2>
<p>(PENDING)</p>
<ul>
<li>The five-year process for she to join NFC -&gt; Might make more sense instead of taking this long to join &quot;NFC&quot;, it's the time spent to join TLO.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-school">High School</h2>
<ul>
<li>（人事Theme：几番苦痛折磨、理智是后天的美）小时候也顽皮、[[冷先生|冷先胜]]管教甚严（但并不是严厉、只是严格、并不厌学）、少许多乐趣（尤其那会儿不晓得[[九层楼]]创建没有、楼外的话就尤其如此——概念上而言，雪映和张鹤该是从小就在九层楼长大，所以九层楼的创立少说也得有20年了，因为[[九层楼]]志的主体发生在雪映成年、执管冷家大小事务之后）；最幸福最痛苦的时光、年少时候的被追求、嬉笑什么。。。</li>
<li>（人事Theme：爱是理性的感知）对父亲十分感激、不为了自己的成就和教育、而是从小没有母亲父亲对自己和家庭专注投入至今对自己的教育方法等也颇为细致等等；不晓得后来发现生父母早死会是什么感觉</li>
<li>(Art) Made the drawing &quot;Blank&quot;, an expression of an artist's delimma and complex conceptual process that's not necessarily involved in the actual painting process itself (which can be quite intuitive, with less focus on design)</li>
<li>(#Interpersonal, Relationship) 对于Tao Ye的印象：这个叔叔个子不高，并且不像其他大人、总是显得很容易亲近，精致的独居者（我们要从并不一眼appealing的外表上通过人格塑造来产生admiration和affection，就好似别人对于雪映的印象一样。</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="post-high-school">Post-High School</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>（发生在小时候或者现在也可）幸福早餐：每天早上刚醒来，惺惺松松，肚子有点饿，还不想立即从床上爬起来的时候，传呼一声冷沐，冷沐就会用一个大盘子从厨房端来新鲜的早餐——玉米蛋花羹、皮蛋瘦肉粥、豆浆油条小笼包。吃饱了再起床、整理床铺、洗漱。那段日子感觉是雪映小时候最幸福的时光。清晨洗漱和早餐完毕第一件事是去给父亲问好（从小冷先胜就不跟雪映一起用餐）；有时候父亲会在做早晨的功课，雪映就会先坐在一边的走廊上（日式建筑，这个区域的名称带确定），给冷先生把茶沏好（雪映不在这个事一般是白斩或者冷先胜自己做）。冷先生会询问功课和其他一些事务，然后再dismiss。晚上雪映有习惯在冷先胜睡觉前（很早、时间固定）回到家然后来请安。（其实冷先胜并不Care？因为请安的时候也只是在门外都不会见到面）</p>
</li>
<li><p>并非素食主义，但是因为父亲冷先胜为了修行和个人偏好而严格只吃素（不食用任何动物制品包括牛奶和鸡蛋），所以在家有时给先生亲自烹饪、就也习惯上很喜欢吃素。寻常时候也会使用中式素食，但就不喜一些西式素食；偶尔也吃那些肉饼状的汉堡</p>
<ul>
<li>喜欢自己一个人在[[九层楼四楼]]进食、与萧何娜还算熟悉</li>
<li>九层楼里另一个人也是会提到素食主义的，即Tao Ye；其动机自然都不是所谓健康，而单纯是保护动物、共感之心</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adulthood">Adulthood</h2>
<p>CP Profile: 25 years old with 23 effective years it's already 192720 hours. (Including: Social service, social construction; Electronic gaming; Transportation, Parking and site seeing; Published Arts and Writing, Meditation and Praying; With additionally sleeping, studying, planning. NOTICE IT'S DEBATABLE WHAT COUNTS AS CP.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Relationship with Tao Ye: (Writing) 冷雪映和Tao Ye后来的affection到sex的发展应该两三次渲染之后逐渐build up，不然的话直接开始挑逗和发生会显得太唐突。</li>
<li>(Duty) 成年后担任冷家在九层楼中的职责（之前是由冷家的另外一个人来负责——<strong>？？？</strong>）（不是冷先胜——这个人物始终是在幕后的）。主要变革是完全取消<strong>受法律保护的婚姻制度</strong>并且提出完全由九层楼负责养育的未成年项目和<strong>Mentor制度</strong>（在这之前九层楼就已经没有婚姻制度、但是仍然限定biological生育和抚养关系）、提出<strong>九层楼推荐规则</strong>、<strong>醉生楼</strong>的创立（这儿或许还有个故事——张鹤早年或许也想过约炮这种流行的行为？男男女女按耐不住身体萌动的荷尔蒙而这样去作为、该是很正常的，尤其是在西方国家、而九层楼本身就是个文化超级包容的环境）</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="canonical-novel-period">Canonical Novel Period</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Interpretation) Relationship with Xiao Kan: 对萧衎的态度可以看作是路人境界的爱、也一部分是作为对于他的回报，因为雪映看待人与人之间的关系是按照九层楼的态度、又知道萧衎是无法做到那一种理想的境界的，所以不如留一点悬念的好。</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="period">醉生楼 Period</h2>
<ul>
<li>Incident at 醉生楼 (Deprecated): It was Jerry Sun (the &quot;Player by nature&quot;) rather than Xiao Kan who had sex with Catherine during that unexpected 2-day earlier entrance into Euphoria. This is a story that we do not need to tell in Saudade but nonethless much legit as a background story for Catherine. (Remark, #20211230) This story cannot happen if Catherine was biologically a guy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>
<h3 id="gender">Gender</h3>
<!--(Remark, #20211229) The suspicion/idea that she could possibly be a guy at the beginning occurred long-time ago; At that time and even until now I feel it a bit too heavy for a soft girl like her, but there is no logical reason for us not to pursue this way. The bottom line is: 1) most of the time the readers shouldn’t need to be aware of the fact she is actually a guy’s biology; 2) We should have built up such suspicion and hints everywhere that when we finally release that she’s actually a guy, it’s just natural. Conceptually, she is treated just as a girl. I think it’s fair that we explore the femininity of ourselves and of everyone and into the subject of gender as a social construct (like how we keep long hairs ourselves) - the naive understanding here is that it’s partly a personal choice and partly a social (forced) choice, yet both femininity and masculinity is within everyone no matter the gender since our mind is of the same kind, capable of perceiving, understanding and emulating each. The key is to provide readers enough contexts and be gentle enough so it’s a comfortable transformation of understanding.-->
<p>She is actually a guy. The understanding and even romantic intimacy with Charles is one reason why Catherine is so attached to him. It might be that after Mr. Leng picked her up from the orphanage, Mr. Leng explicitly allowed and in the future treated her as a girl, so her gender identity has been assumed that way since.
This has been kept a secrete to Zhang He. This wouldn’t be a problem since the most time they spent together it was during childhood and before the full bloosm of adolescence.</p>
<p>There are several hints we might use early on to denote her unusual (gender) identity:</p>
<ol>
<li>（白斩的心理独白，对雪映）“她有着不同寻常的身世”</li>
<li>She absolutely pushes for gender-neutral toilets; She uses toilets only at home or privately in most places; She absolutely pushes for sex-positive and sex-active 醉生楼 related projects</li>
<li>She has complicated romantic/sexual attachments to both guys and girls (白斩)</li>
</ol>
<p>She may or may not perform a trans-gender operation in the end; This gender issue will definitely cause trouble and conflicts with 张鹤 when he came back as a grown-up especially since Zhang He is a bit conservative/traditional. Ideally, we would still expect 张鹤 to be her final destiny - but since Catherine is in The Last Order, it’s completely nonsurprising if it didn’t end up this way. We will see what we can do about the biological nature of males and how that will alter her voice and body forms - certainly she won’t have pretty breasts and voice can be an effort 后天 trained, but I don’t want her skin to be coarse, and I don’t want her to take medicine (or maybe she did, why not).</p>
<ul>
<li>(Remark) 雪映一开始的性别只能是男孩子，因为她后来是要变成女孩子跟张鹤（会localize Tellurian姓氏）在一起的。张鹤小时候就说：“我不在意你下面是男的女的。”（所以张鹤可能也有点同性恋吧）</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="romance">Romance</h3>
<p>爱情观:</p>
<ul>
<li>爱情从来不是非一人不可，喜欢缓慢的节奏 <!--(Remark, #20220522) It's very hard to truly believe in this: I still have trouble accepting it fully; Hanrui get emotional often with guys she likes a lot. And our original inspiration - that Iskra lied to us about how "careless" she actually is - the only reason being she doesn't like us at all and it's more like an execuse than real believes. What is the reason/motivation that Catherine be like this?-->
<ul>
<li>会表现的不很在意、很independent、no bonding</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Highly empathetical</li>
</ul>
<p>The very early-on and long-lasting admiration is for Tao Ye, and this will shape her personality greatly. The nice thing about this particular pair is that Tao Ye was never in any relationship - so there is no hard feelings or any sick triangular love. In a sense, there is another social tabboo why they can't be together: because Catherine is much younger than Tao Ye (and we need to understand how can someone this young develop romantic/sexual feelings for such an old guy, it must be from both sexual and emotional and maybe spiritual and common-interest perspective, where Tao Ye would attract and directly benefict Catherine).</p>
<p>A (used-to-be) always-be-there friend and good future companion is Zhang He. In fact, we set Zhang He as Catherine's Destined Love because they are good compatible pair. It's simply a matter of timing: when Zhang He started to develop feelings for girls Catherine is slightly younger and didn't fully get it (or at least the sexual part of it). When Zhang He came back to city in 2043 (Catherine at age 27), 2 years before Kun VI arrive in 2045, 4 years before Tao Ye left the city in 2047, Catherine starts to develop a romantic relationship with Zhang He that's different from the earlier family bound. One year after Tao Ye left in 2048, when Catherine was 32 years old, she's officially married to Zhang He.</p>
<p>There are ups and downs with lots of people that we need to fill up soon. What really matters here is that eventually, Catherine reaches a higher level of emotional understanding in the pursuit of love (wait, isn't that the case for everyone in the real world?!); On the other hand, Catherine's general style is a bit &quot;special&quot; compared to the typical modes of romance of modern urban people, due to her special understanding in those matters and special personal experience.</p>
<p>During the time Xiao Kan visited NFC, Catherine happens to be not in love with anyone (for whatever reason) - and in a relatively good mood. And since Xiao Kan think Catherine is cute, Catherine naturally accepted/decided to go out with him a bit. At this time, because of the influence of Tao Ye (they should have already had a few sexual interactions), Catherine is very open in sharing everything with Xiao Kan. The difference or the incompatibility between Xiao Kan and Catherine Leng is lesser of a personality one. No, it's of something much deeper - class difference. The difference is not related to the political differences as one would wrongly expect - there ain't such prejudice and arrogance involved in this scenario. It's more of a practical one - a lifestyle one, we can say. The deep cause is the fundamental difference in preferences and fine personal tastes. This makes sure that Catherine by her nature will NOT be attracted by the mundane character of Xiao Kan (after spending much time getting to know each other deeper and pass through that basic appreciation of everything superficial), even if Catherine can otherwise be attracted by figures that possess &quot;unstable&quot; characteristics (like the bad boy Jack Dawson in Titanic, or Gatsby, or some other guy that I will make up for her). The lifestyle one is a bit factor, for it's less about whether someone is good or bad, it's about personal preferences, tastes and compatibility. <!--An approriate model is Hanrui when viewed at the "Classy" direction; In this case Hanrui is more attracted by "unusual" figures that are not unusually profound in any deep intellectual sense, but unusual in life style and experience. Somehow, for details that I can only guess (or imagine in the positive way), they find each other a good and comfortable and fun match when hanging out and doing daily things together (which is apparently not the case with the real world Hanrui and that guy who just seems to be plainly bad): and it's NOT just because of sexual attractions. For instance, they might have the same music taste or other interesting topics in common. --></p>

<li>“女人还是烧菜时最动人/美/精致”（竹林五友话）是这儿渲染的一种氛围；竹林五友是一种高雅脱俗、丝毫不显风流、性格豪爽洒脱。这儿主要描写的是对雪映的一种欣赏：（萧衎刚来时看到的）“她戴着一顶白色的厨师帽、身穿（不是厨师服、而是一种特别的便衣），。。。。（描写一下切菜时的小心细致和烧菜的动作）。。。（描写一下切配料时的流利）。。。。</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="appearance">Appearance</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>(Early conception) 好胖、好美，笑容和气质，温雅、忧郁而十分精神、笑容动人，美到不可一世；好奇这样的人会是如何的性格和情趣。（灵感来源：Rabba那个白人女孩）（或许跟其他女生相反的是，脱光了反而就目不忍视？）</p>
</li>
<li><p>(202411) She could have Korean horrow movie shorthair. (Idea from) 20241101 路人。</p>
</li>
<li><p>雪映皮肤比较白、圆胖或者瘦尖脸型、与冷先胜稍微黝黑些的外貌完全不一样。倒是（冷先胜）跟张鹤站在一起时人们很容易觉得他们是父子。注意到皮肤归皮肤、穿着风格和搭配其实十分的重要，尤其关键是雪映长得不丑，所以只要穿着靓丽清新些、也因为身材只是微胖并非臃肿，所以就可以很好看。再者就是气质本身、若是从举止上来观察，则是另一种吸引力。（注意到这个设定跟原生的梦中还是有挺大差距的、梦里面的那个张鹤身边的大小姐是冷酷的公主气质、皮肤自然雪白，这儿是一个intentional Design decision）</p>
</li>
<li><p>美得很自然、美的不加修饰（参考黄欣欣，不是那种一眼看上去十分attracting十分抢眼的美，但是一种很耐看很清新、不会显得漂亮）：注意到我们其实逐渐发展出两种关于雪映的原型——一种是梦中原生的那种如她名字一般于外人看来或许冷艳高贵典雅端庄动人漂亮华丽的她，另一种则是“相貌普通”“美的自然”、不加修饰的她。我们或许把这两种人格分割出来成为两个角色，因为若单纯是“重要场合和出门时候才需要打扮、却又偶尔自己寻常时候无妆，但却又喜欢探索各种风格穿一些鲜艳或者可爱清新少女的衣服，又如在醉生楼那次的必然是一个艳妆出场”就会显得人物很不consistent（若是那种习惯了惊艳的美，则必然出门都会多少化妆的）。但是某种意义而言、相貌普通、气质出众、举止等细节上见出来，又爱好广泛、性情温和，年幼时曾经冷酷（甚至调皮、性格偶尔暴躁些、即便大部分时候稍微虚弱？）因为那会儿的性格和所经历的事情？</p>
</li>
<li><p>(Pending development) 在家的时候只穿一件oversiezed、long sleeve tshirt？No bottoms, but sometimes uppers? This is mostly for comfort not convince, and when going out people do wear unders for sanity (cleanness).</p>
</li>
<li><p>装扮：右腿上纹一只单脚独立的白色丹顶鹤、鹤抓鲜红；（下身可以是个蝴蝶结？）</p>
<ul>
<li>寻常时候穿着“及膝的长袜”（即便在家），在醉生楼场景和Charles家中曾经出现过不着袜子的样子</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>注意到雪映长相一般（寻常时可见，例如“今天她没有化妆/上妆。。。”），但是妆容可谓出众（毕竟作为一个有生活有品质有经历有情调的人）。</p>
</li>
<li><p>着装：花样丰富，颜色鲜艳；注意雪映的性格不是少女风，只是穿着清新</p>
</li>
<li><p>右手中指没有佩戴风戒（一是冷家不兴数字和穿戴设备，二是日常生活若不是需要保持联系则不需要有风戒、仅仅作为身份识别的话生物特征和身份卡就可以了）。</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>雪映平时（旁听会议、上课、工作？）出门淡妆或者无妆<!--Actually I am changing my opinion on this - since: 1) Catherine is a highly political figure, whether she wants it or not; 2) Catherine is a public figure and there will be lots of people staring at her; 3) Catherine is fashionable, smart and talented, aware of beauty and others’ opinions; 4) Probably there are other reasons. It’s more likely that Catherine actually do have a makeup - a light one, but nonetheless a careful one - so she can give that perfect glow to suit her status. One potential reference model I can think of is 赵桥心美, without that sense of self-centeredness and caring too much others' opinions (there is a difference between being aware of and trying to shape an image vs being worries by what others think); Another potential reference model I can think of is 阎魔爱 - even though she looked young and innocent her appearance is clearly a heavily designed one, with that nice hair style and dress and clean face.-->，懒妆，没什么架子，但是重要和public场合会盛装出席（例如妒天颜婚礼:wedding:）</p>

<li><p>(Catherine Leng) Catherine Leng visits Xiao Kan in the hospital ... At the moment I am thinking that the protagonist, Xiao Kan, is a traveller to a foreign city, named NFC. During his trip however, he's tricked by some evil local ganster and lost his liver in their evil ritual. He's soon sent to the hospital while the gansters are not caught by the police. It's in this particular circumstance and to help the narrative of the media, the daughter of the city, which is popular for its tourism industry, showed up in the hospital in an effort to show sympathy and calm down the public discussion. To show further friendly gestures, Catherine will personally arrange a few matters and show Xiao Kan around the city in a one-week trip. My goal here is to develop some romantic affection towards Catherine from Xiao Kan's end while Catherine is definitely not interested in him.... Show some deeper sympathy... Have connection with Xiao Hena.... Media pressure... Show personal interest in his action back in Kanit/She was reluctant when Mr. Leng sent her to do this (we need to consider whether Catherine is already a cultural symbol and does her action like this make sense at all).</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(association?) (PENDING DELETION) Vocabulary: 欺霜傲雪 - 冷雪映？</li>
<li>She might not be free (to move around and talk about things) after all - Mr. Leng is most likely always arranged her days and delegate a lot of jobs for her to do e.g. monitor the progress of some important construction, send message to some people, take care of daily maintainence of areas of home and other places, learn some stuff and skills, not talking about certain things with others (e.g. About the swords, about the red dragon in watery village), don't meet strangers and tell him about everything has happened to her daily life (i.e. 每晚给父亲请安时候做的汇报) - so sometimes she need to talk as if secretly with Jerry, and her time spent outside is somewhat constrainted.（灵感来源：An unrecorded dream 20190714 about slaying a few summoned dragons in a closed city as a game, where usually normal players only adopt level 1-3 dragons as an attempt because it's always very hard, summoning is even harder. Then after the most evil red dragon was summoned people get to unit together against it. I once entered the mansion of the powerful family as Peter Parker to listen and get news, and I seem to befriend with the daughter of the powerful man. The view of some areas in the city  and the crowded sky of that dream was good visual but due to lack of tech, skill, practice, efficiency, and time and skill in general I could not do it. In one shot the red drag was just curled and floating in the sky half above dense cloud, bidding for his time to attack or watching far away, while a lot of people are busy preparing for the battle below. Some buildings are a mixture of traditional and oriental style).</li>
<li>(Character Design) 角色设计考虑因素: 冷家大小姐会看起来有些冷漠并不是因为她是因为爱情而有些忧郁啊（那样就会很没内涵了）。而且她也并不是那么 冷漠 的。
<ul>
<li>可以理解为只不过对她而言有更加重要的事情去做。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Theme, #Deprecating) 人总是这样——活着的时候不留意也无所谓，直到有一天自己、或者自己爱的人面临了死亡，才惊醒般意识到原来我们的生命也不过是匆忙和渺小的。过去的许多痕迹、本来可以做得更好的事情，此时此刻却只有将事实作为生活的一部分，接受并这样下去。谁曾想到，这样一个环境中的女主人，因为不够在意自己的身体，在实现了那些繁华的光荣背后，死于不可治疗的恶疾（这样的话雪映的传奇身份或许就不方便去继续演绎了，但我觉得这样让故事更为真实和深刻）。(Comment, #20230806) I honestly don't know under what circumstances you were making such claims and how is this story theme applicable to Catherine.</li>
<li>(Quote) <del>“人该有一个理想，但是当机遇来临时，应能够义无反顾的接受改变”</del> (Comment, #20230806) Total garbage, sounds very arbitrary.</li>
</ul>
<!--Deprecated Earlier Notes: 藏剑原因：12岁时她是怎么获得这把剑的就不必多说了吧。    冷家实际是做些什么的我们也没有必要探索的那么清楚。 (Remark, #20230407) Notice there was a beautiful glowing garden/parklet scene from the impression of this scene.
新古典思潮：冷大小姐带领的这一股风气。因为久层楼外部和内部是很不一样的。（这儿倒是有一个场景和久层楼很符合，就是梦记的新的篇章的水上的建筑那一篇，不过我不喜欢船，另外久层楼内没有水域，所以还是不要说了吧）

（四大家族：罗斯柴尔德必须是有的，这些自以为是的外星人当然是有必要所谓的“控制整个世界”，不论在哪儿。但是这话的强度就跟韩国声称整个宇宙都是他们的一样。没错，我的意思是这话是他们自己放出来的。假设他们存在并且控制消息这么多年，那么消息不可能是别人放出来的，因为他们这么厉害。假设他们不那么厉害但是消息上这么说很明显就是谬论了。）（这么专制独权的要么是变革之前的事情，要么干脆就不要发生）总有一些小人物很活跃，一笔代过即可。换个名字。在楼内也存在。  这些小人物如果仅仅是为了烘托一些娱乐的气氛我觉得可以省略。或者是凑一些字数。（和设定本身无直接关系，另外有和无对于想要表达的内容都没有影响）-->
<ul>
<li>(Character, Remark, #20220107) (Deprecated)(书名) 冷雪映: I used to mention we should write a book named &quot;冷雪映&quot; - “类似哈利波特的故事演绎；或者参考一部女生视角第三人称的书或者参考一部他人写的传记（或者自传）。跨度女王统治时期到现代。” However now we think about it - is her experience legendary enough to be written as a book? Certainly not per current design. Originally we had this 《冷雪映传奇》idea, effectively giving Catherine tremendous amount of magical power, welding swords and everything. Now she's more like an ordinary, fleshy, real character with sophisticated emotions, somewhat unusual experience to most of the people, having access and done lots of things, but not so extraordinary in terms of bizarre adventures. The bottom line is: Most of the stuff Catherine has done are small things - what have she done professionally, as a career, in terms of creating business value? What’s her most notable “achievement” (i.e. Something she can put on a resume)? I think it’s OK if we don’t have much in this aspect about her before her 20s - but as she gets older, she must have done something more valuable, to the society, e.g. in her 40s.</li>
</ul>
<!--(Remark, Issue) There is some major challenge with this character design: What is her role in the whole story really? If she's just some kind of ordinary person, then we should focus on highlight the traits of her personality through engagement in ordinary events. And in that case, we need to understand her routines and assignments well and her relationship with Mr. Leng and NFC business so we can properly schedule her.-->
<h3 id="original-inspiration-pending-recollection">Original Inspiration (Pending recollection)</h3>
<p><strong>Legends</strong></p>
<p>雪映并非是生女而是养女，后来协助其父一手创办九层楼。
相传雪映身份来历不明，更有调查显示其年龄十分奇怪：不是太长，而是养父女的关系根本就太短了。
每夜雪映都凝视远方的星空，也不知她是在思念什么？</p>
<p><strong>Moods</strong></p>
<p>。。是不会觉得生活无聊的，只不过作为一种Empathy，她知道这个世界的，那不完美的物质一面。我觉得这一个层面可以用作是雪映某一时期的效果，例如成长时；最好伴随一些那个时期的行为和作品这样人物更真实；后来随着物质镜界发展自然任何成熟的个体不再会有“无聊”的感觉，而雪映也逐渐学会更好的生活了。</p>
<p><strong>Themes</strong></p>
<p>Something you will never understand – it’s because she never had such emotions/experience, she treat it most seriously than anyone else. (An idea regarding her romantic life)</p>
<p><strong>细节</strong></p>
<p>雪映天生不愁吃穿不食人间疾苦也因此看不了人吃苦、若是觉得她人有磨难总是想要尽力去筹划帮助（不是从自己腰包里面掏一点点钱来帮助一个人，而是梦想铲除苦痛本身）、总是以为自己可以帮助天下苍生，也因此让自己很疲惫、认为世人心皆善以至于最后丧失了性命（因为九层楼里面放入了一些心怀不轨的人、或许机遇协议的筛选制度并不足够完善来收纳居住者）。</p>
<p><strong>人物形象</strong></p>
<p>平凡（ordinary），这是对雪映的长相最为贴切的描述。没有精致的五官，没有无瑕洁白如玉的皮肤，她也没有着窈窕的身材——你甚至可以说对一个她这样身份的人而言身高稍微矮了一些、对她安静的性格而言嘴巴稍微大了一点，或者她的皮肤略显暗淡了一些。但是所有认识她的人都对她有着一个难忘而深刻（impressive）的印象：当她出现在你面前，穿着那一身恰好合身的圆领深红莲花外套，或者即便是一件普通到不能再普通的灰色风衣，面上那一丝若有若无的自信笑容，当她行为不紧不慢优雅的与人交谈，当她用那会闪动的目光在集会上聚精会神的做演说时，你总是会被那样一种温和善良、优雅得体、自信动人的气质而深深吸引。怎样的平凡让人觉得真实而信服，怎样的美让人感到亲近却不失庄重，怎样的领袖让人感到可靠而鼓舞人心（inspiring）。【Reference see something like Cheongsam when talking about her cloth, both Eng and Chn wiki are nice. Also notice in Big Fish movie we have the actress wearing one nice red cloth as well.】</p>
<!--个子不高，身材并不匀称；脸有些胖，腰很细，臀部却有许多肉；皮肤白皙；我们让雪映某一阶段也有十分姣好的身材吧，不过她的脸都始终是相貌普通-->

<li>Helen：性格不能说温和、那显得太柔弱了些，但至少是并不会显得凸出的。在日常举动和吃饭言谈间会显得纤巧却并不做作、过分缓慢/小心翼翼，表现自然。倒像是性格先天的那种天真积极。
