        <p>Father of Eleven Baker. Former popular sci-fi novelist. Had major influence on Eleven's culture taste in two aspects: 1) Retro and modern sci-fi tastes, including dressing and general interest towards technology, 2) ??? (I forget🥲).</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<p>I was just thinking I don't want someone sounds too white since both Ellen and Eleven are white enough. On 2023-08-05 we went to Fabre to play D&amp;D and had this character who's first name was Shu (术) which stands for practical arts. I am not sure about Guomo's origin yet (likely not &quot;Chinese&quot;), but Shu as last time sounds cool. The &quot;Guomo&quot; part is just from 郭沫若. A likely variant of &quot;Guomo Shu&quot; would be &quot;Guang Shu&quot; (广术).</p>
<h2 id="divorce-with-ellen-baker">Divorce with Ellen Baker</h2>
<p>When two popular, famous, and experienced people love each other, they fall in love hard. After a while, they fell out of love and their relationship became strained, leading to a breakup. This resulted in Guomo Shu leaving the family to pursue his own dreams and find a different lifestyle.</p>
<p>Variant: To spice things up, instead of a typical divorce, Guomo could have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Especially if his happens during the time of Medalian visit - for his own fantasies, Guomo might be easily attracted to an alien girl or extraterrestrial beings. He may have just gone on one elopement, or somehow participated in the grander schemes during that period. The absence of Guomo would leave Eleven with unanswered questions and a desire to uncover the truth.</p>
