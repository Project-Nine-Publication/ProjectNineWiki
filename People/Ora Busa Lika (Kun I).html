<p>The first queen is NOT as magnificent as the others, for she's the first one to propose subsequent queen-making experiments and there will be some struggles adjusting and modifying the scheme to make the policy perfect. Unlike others that follows her will, she only physically lived around 220 years because she was born into an ordinary form.</p>
<p>Under the presumption of the existence of Portkey on Medalian land, Ora Busa Lika was the first one to crack the secret code and met our creators (the Fepulans); She also subsequently unlocked the genetic codes that will allow everyone to invoke the power equivalent to Portkey without needing physical access to the device (the Inherent Divinity) - hence creating the first (next) generations of queens.</p>
<p>(I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR ORA BUSA LIKA TO COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF MECHANISM - EITHER MECHANICALL OR POLITICALLY TO LIMIT THE POWER/POTENTIAL ACTIONS OF THE MEDALIAN QUEEN, FOR OTHERWISE POWERS CORRUPTS AND ABSOLUTE POWER CORRUPTS ABSOLUTELY, AND EITHER THE SUBSEQUENCE MEDALIAN THRONES ARE ALL FILLED WITH CORRUPTION, OR THERE WILL BE SOME MECHANISM TO ENSURE A PROPER 传承. IN OTHER WORDS, WE CAN'T JUST ASSUME ALL MEDALIAN QUEENS WILL HAVE GOOD WILL WITHOUT PROPER ABUNDANT JUSTIFICATION - JUST THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I ONE DAY SUDDENLY BECOME SUPER POWER AND IS ABLE TO ASSASIN COUNTRY LEADERS WITH A FLICK OF FINGER, NO ONE AND NOTHING IS GOING TO CHECK ON ME, AND I WILL MAKE DECISIONS THAT ONLY SEEM RIGHT TO ME BUT ANNOY LOTS OF OTHERS)</p>
