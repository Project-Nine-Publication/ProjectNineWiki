<p>Local NFC, born inside and raised inside NFC, went to Whisper for education. Xia is a very <em>ambitious individual</em> from a rich and cultured family who are at least partially devoted to (though notably not entirely loyal) to NFC businesses.</p>
<p>As originally conceived, Xia family is mostly responsible for generating talents for managing the cultural related aspects of the city<!--Like how Japan manages its special cultural and meat industries through state governance, NFC takes high pride in its own culture, and have government regulation and government talent election for delveoping next-generation talents that aim at promoting its culture in a consistent and ever-growing way. I.e. Instead of promoting random people with diverse backgrounds injecting random and potentially disturbing ideas that doesn't follow some good framework that's unique per NFC culture.-->.</p>
<p>As Xia becomes of age, he is involved in some very fishy and stinky business (aka. human trafficking and government corruption) in an effort to <em>break the convention of NFC inheritage and gain total power of the city to himself</em>.</p>

<p>Name: 夏成楠
Names: Zen Xia, 夏成楠, Xia Cheng Nan (notice it's NOT Xia Chengnan nor Chengnan Xia, because he thought, well, his name is three words in Chinese, why change it to 2 words in English?)</p>
<h2 id="the-wedding">The Wedding</h2>
<p>The wedding process took long at NFC, and there is a lot of preparation and development of bonds between Xia and Du - who knows, maybe they actually liked each other.</p>
