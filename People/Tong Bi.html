        <p>Born in 梅栖镇. Aa Mu's Brother. Born into extreme poverty and latter discovered to have a major disease (not disabled). Seek new like at NFC and met Gao Cong and that's how his life was led astray.</p>
<p>As a worker for Gao Cong, he put lots of people's life in misery, never killed anyone, and dies a very 惨 life - eventually done by Xiao Kan himself. In the end, he's not a bad person.</p>
<p>He was a Tellurian human that's latter developed into a 一个巨大包菜形状的fully automated机器, capable of many things. Legend has it his body is permanently attached to the inside of the machine and has become a singular form.</p>
<h2 id="archetype">Archetype</h2>
<p>Somehow the derivation of this character is a bit &quot;unusual/twisted/inspirational/dark&quot; - I think it's somehow inpsired by our much earlier original dream of that lump of meat we saw through a factory's window.</p>
