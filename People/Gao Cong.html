<p>It took five years to join TLO, just to test commitment, and somehow Gao Cong messed it up (either before he was formally accepted, or after; More likely a cause of resentment would be he failed at the last test). A partial self-centered belief in TLO and a willing to get accepted (instead of <em>originally evil motivations</em>) motivated him to create his own &quot;TLO&quot; - but no one wants some failed guy's religion, so he pretended he's a legal branch of TLO. Unauthorized spin offs like <a href="../Religions/Relief%20Path%20Society">Gao Cong's cult</a> are popular, because at first it's underground, and also because TLO is rather secretive in its organization or the training process (or even if there is such website of information, <em>it's not clear how TLO operates outside NFC, and Gao Cong mostly 在楼外活动</em>). The simplified process, made-up dogmas and all other customs made the enrollment easier for everyone, and allows more ordinary members to join, feel included and contribute to the cult.</p>
<p>Their cult's belief/dogma is all about &quot;relief&quot;, or releave from the burden of this world, from everyday work. It attracts people by hosting a lot of seemingly harmless activities and gains good reputations. The parties are not wild at all (no drug, no alcohol binge, just a friendly neighborhood party, they even help you clean the house), but they are a great chance for members to enjoy the benefits of new recruits since they are the organizers. The thing is, once you are in, it's very very hard to get off, since people are so friendly and they constantly invite you - how can you resist the invitation from a normal friend?! The only way to get out is to leave that circle entirely (that's what Xiao Hena did, she moved into NFC in hope of new peace).</p>
<p>Banished from TLO due to inappropriately having sex with uninformed to-be members by pretending to be an authoritative role in admission, when such a role doesn't exist. Mostly active in places outside NFC, recruiting members all over the country. Headquarter might still be somewhere in Chinnan though, or maybe Kensh (a city in Chinnan, pending province).</p>
<p>Used the house of a traveling couple as gathering place to commit the crime on Xiao Kan, stealing one of his organs. Sent a messenger to notify (thus leaving no trace) Xiao Hena about her brother-in-law and &quot;this is just a warning&quot; afterwards so Hena can pick him up (with suspicion, of course, but might have photos).</p>
<p>Work with ??? (organization name) to sell Xiao Kan to <strong>Interstellar Operations</strong>.</p>
