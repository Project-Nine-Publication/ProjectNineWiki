<p>The Voss family has a storied but complex history in Iluran. They were once scholars and protectors of traditional elemental magic, passing down techniques and artifacts that connect to the region’s ancient magical traditions. However, in recent generations, the family faced mounting persecution due to their association with elemental magic, as the ruling Drakken sought to repress old magical practices. Kalara's parents were suspected sympathizers with the rebellion, and they covertly aided those opposing Drakken’s reign until their capture, leaving Kalara an orphan in the care of the Order of Magisters. Raised within the Order, she developed her rebellious spirit and loyalty to the old ways, eventually apprenticing under Vasilis.</p>
<p>Kalara possess those magical traits - Whisper of Flame, Earthen Sense, Veil of Mist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whisper of Flame: Kalara has a subtle ability to coax tiny flames from sources of heat or embers. This skill is limited to small fires, like lighting candles or kindling, but with practice, she might grow to use this to manipulate existing fire for light, warmth, or signaling. It’s practical for her survival and concealment in hiding.</li>
<li>Earthen Sense: Kalara can sense shifts in the earth around her within a close radius. This ability gives her an instinct for hidden paths, minor tremors, or even approaching footsteps when in close proximity to the ground. As she matures, she could develop this into more refined control over earth and stone, helping her hide or navigate dangerous terrain during her rebellious activities.</li>
<li>Veil of Mist: Kalara can summon a thin, fog-like mist that subtly cloaks her in low light, particularly useful for hiding her presence from Drakken patrols. The mist is faint and only effective in dark or dim conditions, but as she grows, it could evolve into a skill for obscuring larger areas to aid the Order’s escape or concealment.</li>
</ul>
