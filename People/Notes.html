            <!--(Design, Remark) Legendarize, personalize this character so it makes more sense. -->
<!--(Remark) This background is to help promote and provide enough historical rigorousity from a literature point of view, and enough technological background from a technological history point of view, and enough social and literature experience from a personal point of view - such a person as the writer of the novel should be good balance between depth and humor. -->

<li>(idea, 蚕山曲轻, 冷家, Leng Family, Character, People, Mr. Leng, Tao Ye, Catherine Leng, novel) 小说作者<strong>蚕山曲轻/曲蚕山</strong>本名宋粲，九层楼ID Can.Song@nfc.city，外号因此<strong>蚕歌</strong>。</li>
</ul>
<!--(Pending) One thing pending figuring out is when Can Song was born, when the (he?) started to have the idea of writing out as a novel, and when he finished the novel. *Ideally he should be younger than Charles and Mr. Leng so he has more time on such fictional things*. 

Per story plot, *the writing must happen after Charles's timeline on this universe ends* (aka. Kun coming back) - we could even try to capture and reflect this by changing the tone of writing between first and second half of the book. Making the first half more joyful and second half more glamorous. Also even though Can Song might be close to those people, a lot of details can still be unknown and thus **his speculation must have a limit in terms of assertions** - he can write as if things happens in front of him, *but ultimately he just heard of those things and is just recreating what he gathered and imagined to be truth* (if this is true, we must think about how this would affect the available amount of information he can possible tell the audience). Ideally, there are some things that happened and described/illustrated as truth that even the author - I.e. Can Song himself aren't aware of what's behind the facts. For instance, **he may not know the true origin of Sky Dome** and maybe he can only points out several things that might be providing clues but couldn't really pin point how they all fit together.

We can make this scheme/structure much more vividly by making sure the novel itself (i.e. Saudade) begins by telling the readers that this is a recollection of the many years of research into the city, and finally putting together a picture of what happened in the past. The book itself was written in 2050+ (as per Forward 署名).

It also makes sense **for him to mention himself a few times in the novel**. -->
