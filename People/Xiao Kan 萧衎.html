<li><del>喜欢“多管闲事”——尤其是对于女生（例如目睹白斩就是好奇，或者看到了相关新闻喜欢搜罗相关一些九层楼的干事——例如爱丽丝的信息）：总是倾向于十分热情的（多半出于altruism）take initiative。</del><!--相比之下张鹤的性格就比较目的导向、沉着冷静；看起来阳光但是“十分有想法“；我们还需要另外一个十分、甚至有时候倾向于牺牲自己的男生/女生的人物性格，多半有着不是很自信或者光辉的过去、但是发自内心的积极类型、只是生活从来不顺也不是十分（先天物质）优越的类型 - Charles Zhang. (Remark, #20230614) What do you mean? Why do we need such a personality? What does that "- Charles Zhang" mean? Is that referring to Tao Ye, or is it a comment by myself, which we will henceforth refer to as CZ?--></li>
<li>颇有些放荡不羁的自在（由于什么样的家庭背景和成长经历？）（独自国外成长过的人，往往自敛些，除了家庭或者成绩特别优异的，萧衎不属于这一类；若是在国内成长，则多些“愤青”般热忱和冲动，对许多事情都不满）。</li>
<li>(remark, plot) 作为男主，这个人物的一个特征是“无害”，因此大家都愿意有话跟他说，这样小说可以从人物的角度展开（参见《天黑以后》）。</li>

<p>萧衎曾经在(多伦多)大学读土木工程，但因性格放荡不羁，成绩平平，后来主动辍学，回到国内，学习一段时间建筑设计，因为平时喜欢写作、点评时政，后来托家里关系在(北京)找到个电台当记者。大学时候跟舍友（[[陆易]]？）相处，颇了解一点风水和环境学，但不懂军事和古阵法。这个人物的背景可以使得其对于九层楼的建筑、材料（以及科技）以及人文进行一些比较有见解的看法。（例如对于九层楼天罩、天柱结构和材料的疑惑）也可以把多伦多以往地貌、城市街道地点名称都给用上、对比后来九层楼新给的命名。这个背景，加上收到的邀请函，共同构成促使他回去的动机。<!--注意到在我们的故事作品中不浪费一滴笔墨，所以*表达的内容必须有作用*（参见[[语言空间]]），也因此要细致选择。我们在概念上打算把其作为最终[[九层楼志]]的作者、同时不再让其参与到[[九层楼纪实]]这一部分的作者身份中。在[[九层楼志]]中其名称就是[[箫旌客]]。(Remark, #20220522) Conflict: Our later plan was to refer to the author of "九层楼志" as 蚕山曲轻; And even later we plan to screw all that and name the first Canonical novel Saudade/Eapsil with an unidentified author.--></p>

<!--(Remark, Pending, Proposal) 没错，其父张老爷就是听闻自己的儿子消失后亲自来到九层楼后来在此定居并且重新生活的张老爷——小说中从未点名这一点，只是人物性格外貌相仿。张老爷一直后悔当初贪恋权势对妻儿所做的事情，想要挽回妻子的感情，直到后来前妻再婚才死心；后来在九层楼遇到一个同龄的红颜知己，所以虽然贪恋眼花酒色、后天异禀多去醉生楼，但也是个多情重义的人。这种人物的描写在于写实而非虚构(fiction)，所以写法上关键在于对话、情理，直接或者间接的接触或者听闻，而非情节、动作、事件本身。设想参考红楼梦中近似“八卦”的生活琐节描述，以及现实中朋友对话交谈的互相调侃和八卦。另一个重要元素是写作不在人物本身——而是通过人物的见地经历来引出对相关事物的描写，参考红楼中通过描写祭祖来把人物和事物相互混合展示——Original Cultural Content.-->
<p>山东济南出生，本随父姓，3岁父母离婚后改名随母姓，移居北京。继妹<strong>孔娜</strong> (or maybe she has two names? 孔随母姓，萧随父姓)。<!--如果萧衎并不是土生土长的北京人，那么其家庭——如果拥有财富——则必然是通过经商和把握政机。--></p>
<p>Being brainwashed since the very youth, Xiao Kan is an idiot when it comes to politics. However, 萧衎的性格放浪不羁颇具有流氓气质但是有自己的风格和正义感、形态积极 - it’s just the understanding is way off。That’s why traveling to NFC is a transformative experience for him, and that early self-assured sense of justice is crucial in his later behaviors when traveling outside our galaxy. He really believes there is a greater good, no matter what specifics that might entail.</p>
<h2 id="habit">Habit</h2>
<ul>
<li>(remark, plot, perks) 自从知道了[[醉生楼]]之后萧衎闲来无事总是会想到去那儿，但是也总是路上会遇到一些事情；Tao Ye经常会有时（很偏见？）的说（萧衎）“个子很矮”（雪映和张鹤就不提这个）</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<ul>
<li>(design, character, personality) 萧衎分手之后既伤心又不爽，但根据他的性格和挥霍的家庭、以及中国的教育，除去不断想要讨好之外是不会去从自己身上找问题的。他到九层楼唯一的目的是散心休闲，作为一个楼外人（尤其是一个在自己地方生活无忧的）他对于九层楼的价值和社会可以说是最不关心的——或许只是新奇，以及避免损伤自己的利益。除此之外，除了享乐还是看到好看的姑娘就去泡妞，娱乐的心态。</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="appearance-1">Appearance</h2>
<ul>
<li>穿着：“No Compromise” T恤👕。<!--(Inspiration) If this character is more like Jerry Sun🤔 Maybe this T-shirt suits Jerry Sun character better - because Xiao Kan is more "Chinese" and less likely to wear English t-shirts.--></li>
<li>穿着：现有款则轻松便捷的、款式和颜色不挑，价格也不是问题，避免与“俗人”同款即避免有商标的、奢侈品，（累似于Jerry可以喜欢比较搞笑的绘画设计）；设计款则比较偏向；很粗糙、很潇洒、胡子渣渣、不拘小节、偶尔有些落魄不羁的样子，但并不是傻气类型（不知道自己咋的莫名就感觉萧衎进了九层楼之后变傻；参见[[日食记]]的作者风格）；多一点痞气，自己个人缺乏一些才情。</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="romantic-relationship">Romantic Relationship</h2>
<!--Remark: (Concerning the novel) This part of the love story might well be authentic, but we might not want to start the novel with this because it sounds a bit too "templated" and over-abused; But on the other hand, it really doesn't matter how we *start the novel* exactly as long as it's well rendered - this kind of heart saddening love story is certainly more fun (if we render it properly) and more engaging that, say, we start with talking about Xiao's mom's business in Hangzhou.-->
<p>Xiao and Deng started dating since university, after graduation Wu got a chance to 进修 in a better college abroad and Xiao just loves Beijing and don't want to leave <!--(Remark, Modification, Change) Surprisingly, from a realistic point of view, this part of the romance can be much simpler from a modern urban life's point of view: when one person wants to leave a city, and when they seemed to have a great fun great time together, one of them will just want to break up because "there is no more need to stay as lovers if we are not staying together" - and that's such a simple and realistic conflict! Apparently my original attempt was revolved around how when people are lovers they love each other in a sense want to stay with each other forever - but hell no! And either girls or guys - in this case the girl - can easily bring up the topic of breaking up either at the moment of leaving, or pretend to keep in touch for a bit and then just "fade out". Either way, I think Deng has already had enough with this relationship that's apparently not going anywhere, or Deng is just too ambitious and not interested in staying lingering in this mild but not super hot relationship any longer. -->, there were arguments and conflicts start to emerge (which existed before, but only becomes apparent and brought up when there is need to make such decisions), in the end things get worse and they just have to break up. It's certain that Wu is only seeking her better future, and despite her love for Xiao the differences in values is what ultimately separates them apart, not the mere coincidence of where to live and seek future development. <em>Three months later</em>, Xiao received the letter from Xiao Hena - and that interests him.</p>
<p>Xiao Kan's love for Eleven symbolizes eternal commitment. Eventually he becomes a machine form, and they went back to Tellus together - the machine form symbolizes his commitment to her as solidified concret material matter. One can imagine a image that he (a chromium humanoid machine) holding her at his hands, her right arm around his neck.</p>
<h2 id="the-impossible-romance-with-catherine-leng">The Impossible Romance with Catherine Leng</h2>
<p>The difference or the incompatibility between Xiao Kan and Catherine Leng is lesser of a personality one. No, it's of something much deeper - class difference. The difference is not related to the political differences as one would wrongly expect - there ain't such prejudice and arrogance involved in this scenario. It's more of a practical one - a lifestyle one, we can say. The deep cause is the fundamental difference in preferences and fine personal tastes. This makes sure that Catherine by her nature will NOT be attracted by the mundane character of Xiao Kan, even if Catherine can otherwise be attracted by figures that possess &quot;unstable&quot; characteristics (like the bad boy Jack Dawson in Titanic, or Gatsby, or some other guy that I will make up for her).</p>

</ul>
<p>Below are originally time-unidentified speacetime anchored timeline events, we are yet to merge them into appropriate time per Xiao Kan's experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>S65.02: Eleven Baker Was Sold to Some Rich Guy</li>
<li>S65.03: Eleven Met Xiao Kan.
<ul>
<li>(Note) Here is one potential (though somewhat lame) way that it could happen (or it's not lame, but plain, and can be interesting if we focus on character rather than plot): Xiao Kan was appparently a slave, but slaves at Medala are like pets, not labours. So Xiao Kan effectively follows another owner; When two rich owners met, their pets met, and Xiao Kan started to fall in love with this girl, because: 1) It's fun environment, they have food and drinks and everything; 2) They might even have sex; 3) They are both 同在异乡为异客, and it's more of a 惆怅 and hopelessness and desire for freedom rather than rebellion.</li>
<li>(Note) Here is the reality: Pet owners either have or do not have sex with pets, both options coming with strong opinions - for the former case, it's lesser a pet in our animal-pet sense, but more like a merchant goods, an exotic object, a personal possession, thus possible for sexual purpose, and maybe even share with other friends; For the latter case, such local Medalian people will have a bad altitude towards Tellurians, like how they look down on them - which I think is less probably since Medalians should be somewhat better educated especially in terms of human rights (and especially since if they already protect animal lives, so will be other alien species; Although it's also hard to justify if they don't even hurt other animals, how can they reasonably keep them captive). Either way, hard labour was rarely necessary, unless, it's for household 日常起居 stuff (like a profession), or it's intentional as part of the training purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>S66: Xiao Kan Met Aa Mu's Brother.</li>
<li>S69: Eleven and Exotic Singer.
overview &quot;(Design) Instead of letting Eleven being bought and controlled by some rich people - lame and cliche, we can let her meeet a <cite>philosophical singer</cite> in the distant world: <cite>You are my sex servant.</cite> <cite>What do I do?</cite> <cite>You have sex with me.</cite> <!--It's not slavery, in a sense she's well treated and live a luxury life; It's not marriage, in a sense there ain't such bondage - it's more like professional duty, like an escort for life, with a bit more self-constraint.--> <cite>Do you love me?</cite> <cite>What is love?</cite> In fact, its his such altitude, that Eleven can't accept, and he will just let her go when Xiao Kan offered a better future. (idea from) How it's not possible to really have that feeling of one person that we love and love us forever - when you think about how a sex doll lacks an emotional component for our <cite>soul</cite>, but really, nothing can ever feed the appetite of our soul.&quot; (Remark, #20230406) This kind of money-traded relationship is actually a very realistic of the subtle reality of modern society.</li>

<li>S75: Xiao Kan Met Aa Mu.</li>
<li>S76: Aa Mu's Brother Lose Contact or Die.

<h3 id="fate-the-overall-judgment-of-personal-destiny">Fate - The overall judgment of personal destiny.</h3>
<p>Pushed by the tide of times and life altered by unforeseen powers lying ahead of him, his fate is a result of conformation, confrontation, struggle and settlement that’s not usually controllable on his own.</p>
<p>萧衎是一个小粉红，he is simultaneously despising anything “western” (reject those things and mock others who enjoy e.g. western technology) and privately curious in their development. We must show this before sending Xiao Kan to NFC in the novel.</p>
<h3 id="fate-the-critical-link">Fate - The Critical Link</h3>
<ul>
<li>(People, story, plot) There is a potential for 萧衎 to become the Misssiah - bridge between two worlds, a powerful voice for people to unite together against upcoming Kruks. (Later we said he will become a Krukian-made hybrid/cyborg for Eleven)</li>
</ul>
<p>His linking aspect are shown in two aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>He alone went from a Tellurian to Medalian world and eventually become a Kruks</li>
<li>He got in contact not just the Tellurian world, the 涪陵境界, but also has contact with Xiramus and The Fepulans - he's representative in all those domains</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="introduction-to-nfc">Introduction to NFC</h3>
<!--(Remark) Wait, is that a cousin or sister in law? If it's cousin then they don't need to have the same last name.-->
<p>萧衎父亲（曾经）十分有钱，但是相比之下母亲这边生意还算宽裕，但是呆在北京的萧衎生活还不错但是工作压力很大，成年后自己还是很穷。恰好跟女友分手有一段时间，自己一个人也有些按捺不住继续待在北京，公司的工作很繁琐、老板和同事之间很多各种不顺、腐败。萧衎是一个不羁自在的性格，就差一个机缘。</p>
<p>In year 2035, 25-year-old Xiao Kan received an invitation letter from his 23-year-old cousin<!--另有说法不是单纯邀请来玩而是刚好或者借用所谓九层楼新的移民计划拉拢人才。--> from NFC. It was suspicious, but the rendering is made so that Xiao is joyfully surprised and grateful for her still missing him after such a time - &quot;my cousin has always been close to me&quot;.</p>
<!--(plot, idea, design, proposal) 萧衎刚入楼，但是是类似于新移民的身份，受到邀请（因为[[妹妹|（萧）？？]]有联系、外部亲属可以优先），所以应该有自己的单独的居所的，不然的话可以安排他跟一个室友/妹妹/妹妹的朋友/当看狗人。萧衎作为故事重要主角，代表着寻常的普通人——自始至终没有能够真正走进到天来人、九层楼、冷家的世界/圈子中，一直到他离开九层楼、带随着读者，都未必弄明白这样一座城市完整的运作原理和与外界的关系。这儿十分重要的一点（启发），是珺和冷先胜的斗争可以是十分隐秘、private的，甚至并没有大到涉及到外部势力、其他国家的军队、或者城市的摧毁。这样也更合理、接近自然一些。-->
<h3 id="delay-an-epidemic-across-the-globe-makes-xiao-kan-unable-to-go-home">Delay - An epidemic across the globe makes Xiao Kan unable to go home.</h3>
<p>The trip at NFC was supposedly only a short one - per original Gao Cong’s invitation, it was just a month. But an epidemic break out, and even though people in the NFC are not affected, due to closing borders, Xiao Kan cannot go back to China. So he had to move from the temporary visitor inn to a permanant housing.
The good news though, Xiao Kan’s mother still gives him money so he doesn’t need to work.  In this circumstances, Xiao Kan has three options: 1) Go pursue a degree, ideally a master, 2) Find himself some job and earn some money anyway, or 3) Feel bored. First he needs to get a work permit.
Xiao Kan used to study mechanics, through some socialization with Catherine’s upper-class parties during her compensation to his damage,  Xiao Kan can find a job in the robots industry.</p>
<h3 id="time-in-nfc">Time in NFC</h3>
<!--New: When Xiao Kan fist visited NFC, 醉生楼 was still in concept phase - Catherine mentioned it once during her trip showing Xiao Kan around, but Xiao never visited 醉生楼 himself. -->
<!--New: When Xiao Kan returned to NFC, 醉生楼 has already been a mature industry. Since Xiao has never been there, he wouldn't have made that sexual aquantaince with Catherine - more likely that not, it's Jerry Sun who did that, who's a player by nature, and it's also Jerry Sun who met 张老爷 and other legendary figures at that place. -->
<!--New: Xiao Kan's destined lover is NOT 红练 because he gave up the chance to work with her closely when he refused to help during their first trip to Undercity; Instead, his love to Eleven Baker has a much stronger foundation and bound since he sacrified his body for her. -->
<h3 id="meeting-catherine">Meeting Catherine</h3>
<p>As the two characters grow closer over the course of their excursions together, Xiao Kan gradually develop affections for Catherine. By the end of the trip, Xiao Kan realizes he doesn't want her to leave. <!--Just this subplot itself can be well developed if we invest in enough and it would be beautiful and romantic considering how awesome NFC is.--></p>
<h3 id="working-in-nfc">Working in NFC</h3>
<p>He can be a teacher, for high school kids, that helps bring up topics among school (like real ones, not Whisper ones)(e.g. she might encourages him to see some kids; This is a good theme but two critical aspects must be present if we are going to be able to use it at all: how does this relate to the central plot, and what does he learn from that. How can this part be relevant and engaging at the same time? Maybe a student get lost?), and how he as an adult sees those children. Maybe anyone can teach, and for kids as teacher, students will be adults, who knows proper manner. Xiao kan teach younger people.</p>
<h3 id="discovery-of-airi">Discovery of Airi</h3>
<p>The discovery of Airi (planted by Charles) while playing Pocket Universe might have provided him with further clues and exploration tasks.</p>
<h3 id="the-inter-galactic-trade">The Inter-Galactic Trade</h3>
<!--Here is how Thyken might have been sold: 钱花光了，找工作不想辛苦，找个AV男优的职位，在一个看起来正经的面试，轻易通过面试，待遇据说还不错。后来就到了外星。-->
<p>Sold by <strong>Gao Cong</strong> (among other intermediaries) to <strong>Interstellar Operations</strong> to forign stars - he necessarily made acquintance with one to three friends most of which died at the time of reaching the destination.</p>
<h3 id="meeting-eleven">Meeting Eleven</h3>
<!--Xiao Kan was already in a decent relationship with Eleven way before they find a way to go back; At that time Xiao Kan decided to sacrifice himself and exchanged body with a Kruks, operated by a third greedy operator; The operator took away most of the useful components, and the Biotics Core alone costs Xiao Kan most of the money, besides the operation cost; That guy promised to look after Eleven when Xiao Kan was gone; In the end the greedy operator used minimal components and he's kept inside a most basic spider-shaped Kruks body, and thankfully the biotics core is indeed given. He watched himself (the now-humanized Kruks) have last sex with Elevel then headed away inside the new body to seek a new fortune. In the end he managed to find her and it took some effort to make her trust him again, since that Xiao Kan body was now messing aronud and left her alone (hence making sure they won't make a baby, which will be an emotional burden later on). Later when he gets bloody rich, he exchanged body with another guy, a dying slave from heart attack, re-nourished the body, and put his mind in.-->
<p>He agreed to help <strong>Eleven Baker</strong> - then they would seem as perfect lovers at that time - and he found a contact to conceal and freeze his body and transferred his mind into a machine so he can become a Kruk. Hence become the experience of living as a next-generation bio-tech being.</p>
<h3 id="back-home">Back Home</h3>
<!--(Reference) The Great Courses Plus documentary on North Korea-->
<p>The interstellar trip took him 20 years to finally get back home - and that is lengthened due to space travel time dialation.</p>
<p>When he finally and lastly returns back to China it's 40 years later. His parents have died and none of his aquaintances would recognize him (thankfully Eleven was with him). At that time, China has completely entered the communism regme. Everyone is very happy, ignorant of what's going on in the outside world. Since he has lost the validity of his passport and he's on the list and he's &quot;brain-washed&quot; both by those westerners and those aliens, he's immediately put into concentration camp and needs to work 16 hours a day. Eventually he will manage to escape (maybe Hong came and find him) but that's outside the scope of our novel.</p>
<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>(design, discussion) 原先想到个名字肖博易，但一来不好听，二来觉得设计跟Jackie Liu（刘博易？）冲突，就取消了——“小报记者、喜欢新鲜事物、也不算太得志类型；喜欢摄影；风格化穿着打扮（胡渣渣）；生活粗糙些、人物奔放些、潇洒些；（具体记者生活、经历、一些行业里面的规则和状况什么可以以采访形式邀请张姐来给我讲一讲）”其中的一些性格和形象特点是属于萧衎的。另外关于记者和写作身份，因为萧衎和Jackie Liu冲突，所以可能就取消。再者也因此我在九层楼的那些日子（不管这个概念存在不存在）也与萧衎无关。为了符合他的洒脱性格，记者等辛苦行业或许不适合他，即便是“入错行”，倒是可以考虑偏美术一点的、或者就更加底层一点的小工。原先还给他标签“传奇人物“，取消。</li>
<li>Originally modeled after Jerry Sun - now that part of information should be split between Xiao Kan and Jerry Sun, the NFC visitor character.</li>
<li>(Character, Design) 萧衎就叫萧衎吧，飞机上遇到的那个人（跳伞不带伞的）可以叫做孙俊杰。萧衎的外号之一（萧何娜用）就叫萧快乐。
<ul>
<li>萧衎第一次给雪映自我介绍的时候，雪映想了下，就直接说出“哪个Kan呀？”“这个字有点难写，就是双人旁加个干和行走的行的右半边”“萧快乐？！”</li>
<li>萧这个姓很必要，一来妹妹姓萧，二来“玉人何处教吹箫”谐音；人物原型自然是参考现实化的Jerry Sun（或者参考我们自己本来坐在酒馆的那个impression好了；即遍如此，我们还需要找到更多aspects的solid的参考）；而孙俊杰那个人物则是奔放aspects的JS。这样萧衎的英文名也就不必是Jerry Sun了。</li>
