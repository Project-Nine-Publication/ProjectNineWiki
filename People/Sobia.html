<ul>
<li>This character's name and overall features do have a striking similarity to Sophia the Saudi Arabian robot - but that's where the similarity ends. In a future where female intelligent robots are common place, we cannot compare individuals simply because they are of the &quot;same kind&quot;. Sobia in our dream is much more personal. It's a little bit unfortunate the names sounds very similar but Sobia is actually a beautiful name in English, and they mean very different things.</li>
<li>Sobia (as in the fast food restaurant) is a cute short/medium-curly-haired girl with artifically colored purple-ish color. She has a rather well-defined (since she's manufactured) face feature and looks pretty. As personality goes, she's kind and somewhat quite for someone who looks so energetic and enjoys ordinary world stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>(PENDING MORE POLISHING)</p>
<p>Name: Sobia<br />
Legal (Full) Name: Sobia Advent<br />
Originality: TME Group, Culture A12<br />
Born: Year 5012 at age 22<br />
Husband: Yosaf Ib Bahrim</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Who created/manufactured Sobia? Manufactured by TME Group in Year 5012 in the 12000th batch, sold to a (Russian) family in latter that year.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are other similar kinds to Sobia?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What's the life-time story of Sobia?</p>
</li>
<li><p>If Sobia is a manufectured robot, whose memory is Sobia based on? If that memory is ANN-learnt rather than hand-crafted, what kind of hidden intents/motifs would that artificial neural network have (called &quot;Latent Capacity&quot;)?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What's her impact in terms of the Canonical story?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What's her impact to the surrounding communities and to what extent does this affect the city of NFC as a whole? Sobia was once the hit of news coverage when she was first spotted in the fast food restautant, then she's again a major influencer when it comes to the legalization of robot marriage along with her husband Yosaf?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Yosaf heard about the story of Sobia on newspaper when he was 15 and at the age of 20 he went to find her in the restaurant where she worked in on a visit to a rural town. He didn't meet her on tha day. 3 years latter he found her again.</p>
