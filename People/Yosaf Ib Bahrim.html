<p>Yosaf comes from a Middle Eastern family with traditional values and expectations, but he is a free-thinker who is interested in exploring new ideas and challenging the status quo. Since very young, Yosaf was interested in fields related to robotics and artificial intelligence, given the trend of the society at his time and the contact with Medalian species and possibilities of advanced human civilizations. He have a talent for programming, engineering, and design, and he is a prodigy in his field.</p>
<p>Yosaf is a self-taught genius who spends his free time tinkering with machines and studying advanced mathematics and computer science. He is not in a hurry progressing through schools. He was accepted accepted into a prestigious local university program focused on robotics and AI at the age of 18.</p>
<p>After the information/video leak, Yosaf saw her photos and knew her appearance but wasn't particularly interested at first because it's just some news. Sobia was a public figure then the news of her cooled down and she's forgotten because of all the other urgent matters of the world and society. The news was mostly more concerned not with Sobia per se - people DO NOT even know how intelligent or human-like she is, but rather latter the focus of the news was towards the military/government intentions. Through a chance encounter, Yosaf saw Sobia at the fast food restaurant where Sobia works. Yosaf is waiting in line to order when Sobia approaches him and asks if he needs help. Intrigued by her lifelike appearance and friendly demeanor, Yosaf strikes up a conversation with her and learns more about her background and capabilities. He felt she's very familiar from the past but couldn't recall who she was, untill he latter recalled she's the robot from the news from 5 years ago, where she didn't even age a bit. From there, the two continue to interact whenever Yosaf visits the restaurant, forming a connection that eventually blossoms into a romantic relationship.</p>
<p>His admiration/love for Sobia may motivate him to challenge the societal norms and push for greater rights and recognition for intelligent robots, even if it means going against his family and community. Eventually he would marry Sobia and challenge the established status quo of the society when it comes to the legality of marrying a robot.</p>
