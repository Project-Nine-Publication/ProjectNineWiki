        <p>Known as &quot;The Cold Queen&quot; (pending more literary name), her body is not fleshy but a shiny golden shell.</p>
<h2 id="journey-to-earth">Journey to Earth</h2>
<p>The mission of Kun VI on the way to Earth is twofold: 1) Find out details regarding what happened and whereabouts of Kun VII; 2) Establish trade and military route to Earth with early investigation data and information. In fact, part of the construction work might have already been in place since Kun VII left or even earlier time - some routes can overlap well-established trading routes and depots between Doma and other systems. <!--Here is a technological quirk to be aware of: StarGates using the mechanism of wormhole, though practical and theorically unlimited, takes more effort to construct and has practical limits in its traveling distance and scale. Portals summoned by the queen, on the other hand, are undestructible and has no practical limit except it usually requires Queen to activate, or otherwise is very limited (dependign on implementation) by how often it can be used. Queen, however, can in practice perform large scale teleportation without ever constructing a gateway first - but it can be very demanding. Also, queens may seem vulnerable when portkeys are not at hand.--></p>
