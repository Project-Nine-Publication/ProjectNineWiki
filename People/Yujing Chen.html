<h2 id="early-life-and-education">Early Life and Education</h2>
<p>Chen Yujing was born in Wuhan, Hubei Province, to a family of civil servants. Her father worked in regional transport logistics, and her mother was a local history teacher. Chen displayed an early interest in literature and societal issues, publishing her first essay on press freedom at age 15 in a provincial youth magazine.</p>
<p>She attended <strong>Fudan University</strong> in Shanghai, majoring in Journalism and International Relations. During her university years, she interned with <em>China Youth Daily</em> and reported on social welfare projects in rural Anhui. After graduating with honors in 1993, Chen became known for her deeply researched exposés and human-interest stories that blended investigative rigor with narrative sensitivity.</p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<h3 id="transition-from-journalism-to-technology-19941997">Transition from Journalism to Technology (1994–1997)</h3>
<p>While covering a story on digital literacy at Tsinghua University in early 1994, Chen met Professor Li Wenhao, whose campus-wide digital message board had become a hub for student discussions. The two found common ground in their belief that information systems should foster understanding, not overwhelm.</p>
<p>Together, they launched <strong>HY Bulletin</strong>, an online platform that initially served as a hybrid between a student newspaper and message board. Chen oversaw the editorial and content direction, while Li handled technical infrastructure. As the platform gained traction beyond the university, they formally co-founded <strong>Haoyang Technologies, Inc.</strong> in 1997.</p>
<h3 id="media-architecture-and-ethical-curation-19982015">Media Architecture and Ethical Curation (1998–2015)</h3>
<p>As Chief Content Officer (CCO), Chen led the development of <strong>Haoyang News</strong> and the company’s emotional-tagging architecture. She advocated for the <strong>&quot;Tone Axis&quot;</strong> — a categorization system that filtered news based on emotional resonance (e.g., uplifting, reflective, alerting) rather than traditional political or regional tags. This became foundational to Haoyang’s user interface and emotional UX strategy.</p>
<p>Chen coined the term <strong>“algorithmic kindness”</strong> in 2008, and championed initiatives like the <strong>GoodNews Project</strong>, which elevated constructive and community-rebuilding stories during natural disasters and political transitions.</p>
<p>She also established Haoyang’s <strong>Journalistic Integrity Unit</strong>, an independent team of writers, psychologists, and data scientists responsible for balancing AI curation with editorial transparency. Under her guidance, Haoyang became known for promoting calm, clarity, and ethical nuance in the digital attention economy.</p>
<h2 id="later-career-and-thought-leadership">Later Career and Thought Leadership</h2>
<p>In 2016, Chen stepped down from daily operations and took on the role of <strong>Chair of the Ethics Council</strong> at Haoyang. She also became a frequent speaker at international forums on digital well-being, cultural information sovereignty, and AI in media.</p>
<p>In 2023, she played a central role in responding to the “Sunlight Manipulation” controversy surrounding Project Aurora, advocating for the introduction of <strong>opt-in transparency dashboards</strong> and third-party content audits.</p>
<p>In 2024, she was appointed as an advisory fellow to the <strong>UN Digital Rights Charter Council</strong>, where she authored a widely circulated white paper on <em>empathic infrastructure design</em>.</p>
<h2 id="legacy-and-influence">Legacy and Influence</h2>
<p>Chen Yujing is widely credited with reshaping the global discourse around media technology, not as a tool of speed and scale alone, but as a space for emotional care, dignity, and truth. Her fusion of <strong>journalistic ethics with user experience design</strong> is now taught in media programs across East Asia and increasingly referenced in Western digital humanities departments.</p>
<p>A vocal advocate for cultural pluralism, Chen pushed for <strong>multilingual storytelling</strong> on Haoyang platforms, funding Swahili and Tamil content partnerships as part of Haoyang’s expansion into underserved media geographies.</p>
<p>Her name is often mentioned alongside figures like Ellen Ullman and Maria Ressa in discussions about media responsibility in the digital age.</p>
