<p>The single first long living mind and spiritual leader, spurred Medalian need for a Queen of equal immortality.
海尔吉在首领们身边也是如此 像荆棘丛旁复燃的灰烬 和被露水浸湿的年轻雄鹿 雄鹿超越了所有其他动物 而它的角在天空中闪闪发光。——《海尔吉之歌（二）》</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relationships/Friends/Connections: ???</p>
<p>The first Krukian - the mad scientist the puts its own brain inside a machine and invented the first generation of artificial brain.</p>
<p>He is NOT the &quot;大统领&quot; (who is merely a major player by economy size, not by leadership) and rather, he's much behind the curtain and is the spiritual leader of all Kruks (but there are LOTS of diversions within this group so we can't say everyone obeys him).</p>
<p>Spiritual leader of the entire Krukian species, but notably the earlier genrations; Latter generations are too scattered and have their own believes. Most far Krukian descendents do not have direct contact with him (but earlier and close generations do have direct network access with him and adores him as a more intimate leader) and worship him as a religious hero.</p>
<p>Values:</p>
<ul>
<li>He led the Krukians build a new home but also thinks Ids is righteously their home as well. (This might be a conflicting and non-committed idea, we need to decide what exactly does he thinks)</li>
