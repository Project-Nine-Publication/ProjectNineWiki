<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong>English name:</strong> Gao Shi Qiu<br />
<strong>Courtesy name he sometimes uses off-world:</strong> “Old Qiu of the Ninth Ring”<br />
<strong>Born:</strong> 4966, Kanit Federation (Tellus)<br />
<strong>Status in 5025:</strong> Missing from Tellus circulation since ~5011–5012. Believed to be alive and retired in the Krukian shadow colonies beyond the heliopause portal.</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>

<li>Originally from 高逑</li>
<li>Chinese: 高世秋</li>

<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p><strong>What actually happened</strong><br />
Gao Shi Qiu never worked alone. He was the human face and local coordinator for a loose alliance of Krukian memory-harvesters and Ikurian transit brokers who needed a reliable supply of Tellurian bodies and minds after the Queen’s Purge cut off their official supply lines.<br />
When the hidden heliopause portal was rediscovered around 5010, the Krukians offered him the deal of a lifetime: bring your fortune, bring your rolodex, and we will give you a villa on a ringworld where no Tellurian law can ever touch you.<br />
He accepted. In 5011–5012 an entire chartered luxury liner (officially “cultural exchange delegation to Medalia”) left Tellus orbit with 4 200 passengers. Fewer than 300 were ever seen again. Gao Shi Qiu was on that ship, along with his fortune, contacts, and several hundred “voluntary companions.”<br />
He has not been back since. Kanit police closed the file in 5019 with the mention “victim of own emigration scam – presumed deceased.”</p>
<h2 id="relationship">Relationship</h2>
<p><strong>Relationship to Gao Cong</strong><br />
Gao Shi Qiu never knew he had a son. Gao Cong’s mother was a one-night stand in 4992 with a hostess in a Kanit sky-bar. Gao Cong grew up believing his father was “a legend who vanished into space,” which is, ironically, completely true—just not in the heroic way he imagines.</p>
<h2 id="legends">Legends</h2>
<p><strong>Public legend on Tellus (Kanit underworld folklore)</strong><br />
The man who, in the chaotic decade after the Medalian Withdrawal (4998–5008), turned the smuggling of “luxury living goods” into an art form. Drugs that made you dream in Medalian, designer viruses that only killed boredom, black-market memory grafts from captured Krukian soldiers, and—most lucratively—beautiful young humans who thought they were signing modelling or hostess contracts for orbital resorts. Everyone in Kanit’s night districts still tells stories about “Qiu-ge’s trains”: private maglev cars that left Kanit Central Station at 02:00 sharp and were empty by morning.</p>
<p><strong>Current reputation off-world (5025)</strong></p>
<p>Among Krukian and Ikurian fixers he is “that old Tellurian who still pays on time.” He is rich by Tellurian standards, but a nobody compared to the ancient trading houses. He spends his days curating a private collection of memory crystals and human “art pieces” in a pressurized estate on a Krukian habitat. He is 59 standard years old, augmented to the gills, and bored.</p>
