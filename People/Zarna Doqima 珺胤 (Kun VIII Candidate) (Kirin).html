<!--Note on Deprecated Background

* The source dream says Kun VII is Zarna's mother - well, not explicitly, but to an outsider it does seem so. In reality, they are not biologically related, they are just close (sort of like mentors and mentees) per Medalian queen's tradition of selection.
* The later novel conception depicts Zarna as going through some sort of "adlescense" during her time with Charles at Whisper - that's why she would rebell against her mother. Nope. That was completely non-sense. Zarna and Doita is very close and they unite together to break free from the expectations of Medalian traditions.
-->
<p>(Early Conception) Impression: 有点傲娇、敢爱敢恨、敢做敢想、特立独行、能力出众、被宠出来的、多愁善感（毕竟嘛、冷先生也管教她些）、、、
Latest Conception: Highly standalone/indepandent, mildly bold, delicate emphathetical feelings and 善解人意（乐于安抚和帮助别人） - but hates whining.</p>
<p><strong>Archetype</strong></p>
<p>This person is completely unique and dream-original and has no real-world archetype; The concpetualization of this character either is completely random, dream inspired, TI inspired, or logically deducted. For realism, we should draw observaations from varying aspects (pending definition what this means).</p>
<p><strong>Early Conception (Pre-2016)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>珺胤不赞成母亲屠戮地球生命的做法，尤其是因为她与地球人接触后觉得他们其实很好相处、与自己的种族很像。所以在后来向Charles提出可以帮助他，因为不想再看到地球人的苦难。因为年轻、有自己与母亲不一样的经历和见解所以观点不同（因为出发点不同），而恰好自己也有些行为能力，便会与母亲对着干. <!--This is no longer applicable since Kun VII is Zarna's master, they have more of a "professional" relationship; It is however still possible that the young Zarna was on a rebellion against her actual mother back on Ids and against her will joined the army and eventually became the candidate for the next Queen.--></li>

<li><p>Her Medalian name (if so) Zarna Doqima (札娜多奇玛) is derived from her mother's name, both of which follow Konralika tradition.</p>

<li><p>朋友昵称/地球名：银秋吟（待议因为听起来太柔软）</p>
<ul>
<li>(设计指导)听起来柔软的另一个原因是没有来源，所以听着牵强</li>
<li>珺胤的这个名字可以来自于&quot;完颜银术可&quot;，金朝开国大将，也是银姓来源之一；参见《金史·卷七十二·列传第十》</li>
<li>更多可以参考<a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%93%B6%E5%A7%93/10465655?noadapt=1">这儿</a>，有许多内容</li>
<li>&quot;秋&quot;是秋的意象，因为原威斯波尔记梦中Charles跟珺胤是在那个季节相遇的</li>
<li>此名字尚且跟黄庚的《秋吟》绝句无关。</li>
<li>这儿的主要是“秋吟”听起来有点怪，倒不如“秋婉好听”，不过想来挺有诗意</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>中文名：（可以是Tao Ye小时候给她其的，类似于宝玉给袭人起名字）琴欢（来源：秦欢）（但是太武侠了，不好），或者我其实更喜欢红楼梦里面那些姑娘的名字的感觉、但是尚且还不能够道明那到底是一种什么样的感觉——或许是从故事里面选字的感觉（区别于武侠从一些物体中抽字）</p>

<li><p>(20230614) I think it's a typo that we wrote &quot;Zarno Doqima&quot;, but Zarno sounds exotic enough - maybe in that case &quot;Zarna&quot; can be a nickname? Ultimately it depends on the language convention of Shingo.</p>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>Konralika tradition has only four to five stages of education, depending on how you look at it, and not all of them are official:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pre-School</li>
<li>School</li>
<li>High School</li>
<li>University/Collegue</li>
<li>Post-Grad</li>
</ol>
<p>What's more, rich families typically afford private schools (not a single school, but many, for different purposes, at different stages) whose curriculum can be very different from the official one and covers a wide range of subjects and period of time for a person's life; Some teachers only take apprentices for some other specialized crafts and do not exist in the form of large public-facing schools.</p>
<h2 id="romance">Romance</h2>
<ul>
<li>(High School) 伥离爱: She doesn't really dislike her - he's handsome and smart and has a good background anyway, and they did have some good time together. It's just his style at that age is a little bit annoying.</li>
</ul>
<p>A note on &quot;messy&quot; sex life: Per original &quot;Tower&quot; dream, Zarna seduced those guys to lead them away so CZ could enter the control chamber and activate Zeroing. During development of Minocore, we propose that Zarna has a somewhat casual sexual life with lots of people of or above her age from the military. This conception has mostly only some aesthetics issues. To address it, we must realize that Zarna is noble and well-behaved, she's nothing like a fucked up: she may have sex with lots of people, but it's nothing like animal sex but more well tamed and highly selective. With that cleared, is there any possibility for she to have a &quot;淫乱&quot; lifestyle? I think it's completely plausible. First of all, we must realize the reality of her status and travel experience: she's from an advanced civilization, she has power, she's beautiful, it's a small spaceship, and she has all the right to persue fun from mild to intense sexual pleasure. However, we must realize that people at her status MUST if not for anything else then at least for political reasons she must keep it discreet even though everyone sort of knows what's going on. Now, back to aesthetics and high taste, is it any possibility that from her traditional trainings she's highly refrained from sex? I HIGHLY doubt so, and the reason are two fold: 1) I don't believe Zarna comes from religious background and Minbi Eyok alone should not impose limits on sex life; 2) Everyone surrounding her is highly sexual: Mr. Leng, Doita Delin, and maybe her other friends. It is a sexual environment, and people have sex a lot, some are very open. Now, with the realization that Zarna's life is likely very bright and sexual, how do we fine tune the aesthetic flavours of it to make it easily appreciable? I think the key element of aesthetic beauty here is her broader experience of all sorts of things, and her caring personality in general, and a high sense of self-esteem and control, and a modern altitude. It might also be necessary to re-consider what does it mean to talk about Zarna's lovers since it might not mean exclusive sexual relationship - so what does it mean to be in love, or does she ever, in this case?</p>
