            <p>(PENDING COMPLETE RENAMING: WE MIGHT DISREGARD ALL THOSE NAMES AND RECONSIDER AND RENAME ACCORDING TO KANIT CONVENTIONS AND LAST NAME RULES - 萧衎，萧何娜，张老爷，胡祖豪，赵倩雅，孙俊杰，赵世强，孔先生 and everyone related to Xiao Kan in general)</p>
<p><del>萧母再婚对象女</del>。（最新：堂妹）</p>
<p>Traveled to Canada for studies of medicine (since it's hard to study medicine at Canada, she might be going to US instead, but tuition is insane and she's not likely to come to Canada for work) at the age of 18 (no relatives here) or 13 (high school, with relatives here, no particular major in mind) or 22 (after university graduation, pursue graduate studies, no relatives here, in this case she might just choose studies of education; Notice at this age she's not going to join TWG (The Wise Gathering) due to loneliness but maybe activist beliefs).</p>
<p>During her college years she was suffering from loneliness etc. stuff and Joined ???/The Wise Gathering (Gao Cong's cult) and had romantic relationship with Gao Cong, who was a control freak and attempted to limit her freedoms - he has many affairs with other members of the cult but insist on his love to Hena and want her to serve him only.</p>
<p>Rebellion caused strong violence when she was against behaviors as a sex slave or BDSM practices (after she enjoyed it for a while and discovered his lies). After breaking up with Gao Cong have been attempting to get away from the cult but Gao Cong hasn't been easy on her and want her back.</p>
<p>Hena devoted a decent chunk of the later years (she necessarily changed interest after she gets older) in rise against and defeating TWG (Gao Cong's Cult), and put her voice on human rights and women rights movements.</p>
<p>Career: Student at Austinbu; Move to Chinnan and waitress job at NFC; Break up with Gao Cong and business administrator (or event organizer for Catherine leng) at NFC.</p>
<h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>
<p>Names: Xiao Hena, 萧何娜, 萧娜, Giguana<!--(Dream inspired, #20220523) (people gathering event in a private indoor setting) Giguana needs to keep it short, besides, Giguanna either needs it or not (irrelevant of my dress) - Jerry Sun like Naruto, very bizarre and 中二 person, wearing Samuri uniform for a meeting. (Yes, this is Jerry Sun not Xiao Kan - assuming Jerry somehow becomes friend with Xiao Kan and Xiao Hena)-->
Birth: T5012.03.15</p>
<p>其有两个名字：孔娜随母姓、萧何娜随义父姓。</p>
<h2 id="friend">Friend</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Identity) Very trustworthy and close friend of Giguana, highly talented (Like Jake Brota in Bryklyn 99), non-romantic personel. (This is not Jerry Sun; It's someone other than him) <!--Per unrecorded dream #20220523--></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Remark, #20211230) So far this character’s role is straightforward - ordinary life and not that much to do with Xiao Kan’s later journey. This is by all means realistic and good - but it might have been a too mild. so far, by all means her appearance is just an acquaintance playing no significant role in any of the protagonist’ life. Maybe she deserves a bit more attention, and maybe she’s able to get involved and change a few more people’s life more directly - however, we must think: do we really want to make every person’s life a legendary one? By all means, isn’t it a good thing to live a meaningful and content life that you seem to have control of? (Remark) I think the key here might lies in the external environment - is there any dramatic change to the environment she lived in throughout her life? If that’s the case we can expect more bold decisions, otherwise it’s perfectly fine if she’s just an ordinary person.</li>
<li>(Remark, #20230622) At the moment we don't have much personal attachment to this character except her (now deprecated) name &quot;萧何娜&quot; which is a creative derivation from &quot;萧何&quot; and sounds cute. I think if we put more creative thoughts on this character, we will be able to make the character itself more meaningful.</li>
