<p>Everything good.</p>

<p><strong>Haoyang Technologies, Inc.</strong> (Chinese: 浩阳科技有限公司; pinyin: <em>Hàoyáng Kējì Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī</em>) is a Chinese multinational internet and technology corporation headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong. Best known for its all-in-one web portal, curated search engine, and digital media platform, the company has been described as a &quot;cultural cross between Yahoo!, Google, and Baidu&quot; in an alternative global digital landscape. It operates a wide range of services including information indexing, email, community forums, online advertising, AI cloud solutions, and digital news aggregation.</p>
<p>Founded in 1994, Haoyang rose to prominence during the rapid expansion of the Chinese internet infrastructure in the mid-1990s. With the motto “Everything Good” (Chinese: 一切美好化身), the company established itself not only as a provider of digital services but also as a brand of emotional optimism and curated internet experience. As of 2025, Haoyang Technologies operates in more than 30 languages and maintains a significant presence in East Asia, Southeast Asia, East Africa, and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="founding-and-early-years-19942001">Founding and Early Years (1994–2001)</h3>
<p>Haoyang was founded in 1994 by <strong>Li Wenhao</strong>, a professor of computer science at Tsinghua University, and <strong>Chen Yujing</strong>, a former investigative journalist. The project began as a campus information board under the name <em>HY Bulletin</em> (浩阳布告栏), used for posting class notes, announcements, and discussions. It evolved into one of China’s first comprehensive web directories and adopted the name <em>Haoyang Technologies</em> in 1997.</p>
<p>By 1999, the company had launched the <strong>Haoyang Index</strong> (浩阳索引), a hybrid between a human-curated directory and a keyword search engine, and began offering email services via <strong>HYMail</strong>. Its user base surged during the 1999–2001 &quot;Digital Spring&quot; boom, when widespread university connectivity and government support for domestic internet platforms accelerated growth.</p>
<h3 id="expansion-and-diversification-20022014">Expansion and Diversification (2002–2014)</h3>
<p>Throughout the 2000s, Haoyang diversified into news aggregation, forums, messaging, and online advertising. It launched <strong>Haoyang News</strong> in 2003 and <strong>HY Market</strong>, its ad platform, in 2006. With its emphasis on editorial oversight and emotion-based tagging, Haoyang gained a reputation for “algorithmic harmony” — balancing personalization with socially desirable content moderation.</p>
<p>Haoyang became an early proponent of &quot;Soft Globalism,&quot; a corporate philosophy promoting non-confrontational expansion into foreign markets. It translated its platform into over 20 languages and established offices in Singapore, Nairobi, and Jakarta.</p>
<h3 id="the-ai-pivot-and-qiming-era-2015present">The AI Pivot and “Qiming” Era (2015–present)</h3>
<p>In 2015, Haoyang launched its AI division, culminating in the <strong>Qiming Platform</strong> (启明平台), which powers sentiment-aware tools for content moderation, brand analysis, and adaptive user interfaces. The platform was also used by governments and NGOs for public communications, leading to concerns about ethical transparency.</p>
<p>In 2023, Haoyang unveiled <strong>Project Aurora</strong>, an AR and XR initiative integrating curated reality overlays with emotional filtering, sparking both admiration for its vision and controversy over manipulation.</p>
<h2 id="products-and-services">Products and Services</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>HYMail</strong> – A secure, widely adopted email client integrated with business and personal services.</li>
<li><strong>HY Market</strong> – Advertising network with a focus on emotional resonance and trust scoring.</li>
<li><strong>Haoyang News</strong> – Aggregated and licensed news with filters for tone, topic, and bias detection.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="corporate-culture-and-philosophy">Corporate Culture and Philosophy</h2>
<p>Haoyang is known for its corporate mantra of “Everything Good,” which is reflected in its product design and internal culture. The company promotes algorithmic &quot;emotional intelligence,&quot; ensuring its platforms emphasize positivity, productivity, and social cohesion. Employees undergo training in “digital harmony,” a philosophy that blends Confucian ethics with modern UX design.</p>
<p>Its mascot, a red-orange cartoon phoenix named <strong>Yangyang</strong>, appears across products and public campaigns, symbolizing knowledge, rebirth, and good fortune.</p>
<h2 id="media-and-pop-culture">Media and Pop Culture</h2>
<p>Haoyang Technologies has appeared frequently in fictional dramas, novels, and alternate history speculative works. It was prominently featured in the 2022 alt-world TV series <em>Digital Mandate</em>, where a dramatized version of the company played a role in a global AI governance council.</p>
<p>Several documentaries, including <em>Harmony Protocol</em> (2024), have examined the company’s influence on global digital culture and emotional UX engineering.</p>
<p>Haoyang sponsors the <strong>Everything Good Summit</strong>, an annual tech-humanism event attended by digital philosophers, behavioral economists, and software ethicists.</p>
<h2 id="controversies-and-criticism">Controversies and Criticism</h2>
<h3 id="information-curation-and-algorithmic-bias">Information Curation and Algorithmic Bias</h3>
<p>While Haoyang is praised for minimizing misinformation and online toxicity, critics argue that its emotional filtering amounts to <strong>soft censorship</strong>. Several international watchdogs have accused the company of suppressing politically sensitive topics under the guise of “negative sentiment control.”</p>
<p>In 2020, a leaked internal memo revealed that Haoyang’s <strong>Brand Harmony Index</strong> was being adjusted manually for certain government-affiliated clients in East Asia and North Africa.</p>
<h3 id="sunlight-manipulation-scandal">&quot;Sunlight Manipulation&quot; Scandal</h3>
<p>In 2024, investigative journalists uncovered that Haoyang’s <em>Project Aurora</em> was testing emotional filters in augmented reality that subtly altered color schemes and text emphasis to induce calmness — without notifying users. Although framed as an opt-in feature, critics labeled it as <strong>covert mood engineering</strong>.</p>
<p>The company responded by introducing a full transparency dashboard and third-party audit options in 2025.</p>
<h2 id="global-presence">Global Presence</h2>
<p>As of 2025, Haoyang operates in over 40 countries, with strong market share in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>China and Southeast Asia</strong> (core)</li>
<li><strong>East Africa</strong> (via Belt &amp; Road digital partnerships)</li>
<li><strong>Middle East and Central Asia</strong> (cloud services and data localization partnerships)</li>
