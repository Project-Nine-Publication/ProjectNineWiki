            <p>This is the original VMA established in Vandentra nicknamed &quot;Whisper&quot;. The official name for this is &quot;The Cosmopolitan Lyzeum&quot;, and it's a rather small scale school but with its own unique building, i.e. the twin towers.</p>
<p>It's located at an empty park ground very close to center of the city (but to the west), as a gesture to show good peace/will.</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<p>We wanted something that signifies a sense of collaboration and has cultural significance/breakthrough between governments/countries/civilizations, and the german word and school style gymnasium sounds unique enough, and it is also calle Lyzeum.
Was looking for some word that connotates peace, collaboration, and cultural exchange but is not &quot;united&quot; which imply some kind of political alliance. We want to signify economical collaboration, and we found (with help from ChatGPT): Interethnic -&gt; Synergistic -&gt; Cosmopolitan.</p>
<p>From Medalian &quot;Uis(e:)pa&quot; (meaning pending).</p>
<h2 id="references">References</h2>
<p>All of the early 2013-2022 design ideas are attributed to the new Whisper design, so the concept for The Cosmopolitan Lyzeum is quite new - the only thing we are taking/preserving from early conception is the twin-tower design.</p>
<p>In the past, the only concept we had related to the twin-tower design was likely a failed sketch we did during 2007-2009 (when Whisper, or &quot;the tower&quot; dream was first conceived) on an A4 paper (along with our little brown cover palm-sized notebook) which is certainly lost because we didn't have digitalization plan at that time. That's good, because that doesn't contain any useful detail/vision, so we are at a clean state.</p>
<p>At the moment, we are starting afresh and rebuilding from &quot;impression&quot; (instead of trying to recreate an original concept) and put everything inside P9 DA Blender file: Project Nine DA://Blender/Dated/20230102/20230820 Old Twin-Tower School.blend</p>
