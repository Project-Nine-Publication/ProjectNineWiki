<li><strong>Princeton, NJ, USA</strong>: <strong>Mine</strong> was created as a college project by a 3rd year <em>computer science</em> student <strong>Peter Campbell</strong> in 2003, which later becomes the LARGEST social media platform on earth per user share across the globe by year 2020, which owns many subsidiaries including some high-tech entertainment companies including the famous movie/tv/original streaming platform (created in 1998, acquired by 2012) <strong>Chronicle</strong> (second to volume compared to personal streaming platform <strong>ShareTime</strong>, owned by <strong>Nudle</strong> from silicon valley; Another large platform worth mentioning is <strong>AnimHub</strong>, product of a japanese company <strong>Koete</strong> - meaning &quot;Beyond&quot;). The second largest social media platform by the time was <strong>Druidess</strong> (apparently favoured by females). The key feature of this app/platform is it's really life-involving - it provides BASIC tools for things from managing friends, share posts, control privacy and visibility settings, share images, chatting, event planning, news feeds, recommendations, ratings, school-wise friends (校园网), and many web apps and cool front-end technologies.</li>
<li>(Note) A development of original in-world social media technology companies.</li>
<li>(Remark) Consider move to company specific Wiki entry.</li>
