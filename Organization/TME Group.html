At that time (American) military also have this novel technology that the user can generate a basketball sized energy ball on his hand and upon thrown out and contact it will capture an energy (energy or "enemy"?) in mid air in a bubble like energy shell (This inspiration might be from Starcraft, and it's a good sci-fi fantasy feature).
