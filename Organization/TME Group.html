<!--Per 20220316 dream entry--> There ia a short series of movie leaks talking about the inception of such a new generation of machine program shut down by government then later that female agent constantly get harassed by opposing people, media and individuals, and almost get killed once when ~~she was working for a fast food restaurant~~ and was saved by the then aged Xiao Kan (age 55) (so it's many many years later) <!--(Remark, #20230225) Let's arrange it so that Sobia 隐退 to a fast food restaurant instead of becoming publically known there; However, the people who visits that distant restaurant often might all privately knew her identity and were all surprisingly kind to her, because it's a small town and people there - even the gangsters - are very kind to a robot-->. At that time (American) military also have this novel technology that the user can generate a basketball sized energy ball on his hand and upon thrown out and contact it will capture an energy (energy or "enemy"?) in mid air in a bubble like energy shell (This inspiration might be from Starcraft, and it's a good sci-fi fantasy feature).

<ul>
<li>Around year 5012, TME group manufactured 12000 AI robots as a collaboeration between the military and the government (Which government?) for survilent/secret agency purpose. Sobia is the last one from the batch.</li>
