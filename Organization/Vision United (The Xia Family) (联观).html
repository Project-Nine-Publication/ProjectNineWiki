<p>The Xia Family don't use their name explicitly - instead it's associated with a particular organization and works (as a layer of indirection) behind the scene for that organization.</p>
<p>Seperate from the day-to-day operation of the government, it is a representation of further <em>segmentation/specialization of NFC governing functions</em>: <em>culture, diplomacy, economics, executive, law/legislature, judiciary</em>, <em>military</em> <!--The Du-family (which will represent a specific organization, in this case 妒军工 and others) model is an implementation of the Myah's "王意" system, which allows the military to have independant function and responsibility/decision making from the government - we need still to figure out how in this case the city directs/controls/informs the military to do things for it; TO say the least it's going to be a converastion between two leaders: the leader that demands and initiates the request, and the military leader; And we need to figure out how to maintain loyalty and correct interpretation of the military leader and avoid corruption of the military order--> among others.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p><strong>Vision United</strong> is responsible for all kinds of cultural and organizational events (what outside world might call &quot;political&quot;, here at NFC due to its unique tech-drive and open-source nature, it's more of an organization thing), here are some enumerations (pending exhaustion):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>City Design Conference</strong>: Major events that happens twice a year. Think of this as a combination of The Games Award/E3/Apple Annual Event/XBOX Event (in the third quarter) and SIGGRAPH/GDC (in the first quarter), where we provide both digest, nomination of major developments and technical review and discussion of certain subjects in 3 day (for the release event) and 1 week (for the technical event) period. All kinds of people can participate, mostly those profesionally works in this field and those members from the open-source/dev community who are very interested. The topics here cover mostly the CofN OP platform and all its components.</li>
<li><!--Might need a public informative event on the law system of NFC-->
</li>
<li>(Cultural festival events organized by the city, including celebrations for Christmas-like holidays; We always need NOT JUST A THEME, but meaning, information, and something new, so we are evolving and not staying in the past; And such events are NOT about any individual people, e.g. we don't just ask some &quot;government officials&quot; to give 冠冕堂皇 speeches but the candidates are chosen from the public from the figures with recognizable contributions in the field by the public)</li>
<li>(Year-round seminars on cultural diversity and all kinds of general social issues, aimed at promoting awareness; This is like HR/Culture&amp;Diversity/Inclusiveness training at modern companies; Some can seem quite boring and people comlain about the quality of them)</li>
</ol>
