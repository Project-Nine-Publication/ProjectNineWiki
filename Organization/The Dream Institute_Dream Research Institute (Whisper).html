            <h1>The Dream Institute/Dream Research Institute (Whisper)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Brain is the best simulator we've got.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tags: Organization, #Legend</p>
<p>A college dedicated to dream research and sleep research, funded by Tao Ye and part of Whisper, outside and close to the main campuse of Whisper. The Dream Instutitue (PENDING COOLER NAME) is a research/training facility dedicated to specialize the &quot;dream thefting&quot; techniques for entertainment<!--The entertainment aspect focuses on: experience, vividty, ease of access, fun-->, creative and productive<!--For serious, governmental, strategical aspects; This part also contains the "mystical" domains: machine/brain learning, future prediction etc.--> purposes. The Dream Institute also gets involved in dream/sleep related theorapy development, sleep medicine production, and dream-related sci-fi gadgets development (merchandise). Notable among those is its collaboration with Dreamscape. As a &quot;legend&quot;, it's mildly accurate (like what we want with hard sci-fi or hard-fiction): it's only slightly exaggerated in its capabilities and is largely plausible.</p>
<p>The headquarter is in NFC, but there are less than a dozen branches across the world in major cities - the demand is real. The former masters/graduate students of this intitute generally make impressive entries on the world stage in creative domains. <em>One major research direction is to exploit dreams in non-creative, e.g. technical and political domains</em>.</p>
<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>
<p>In front of the Dream Research Institute outside Whisper, there is such a white status depicting a man (the first man with many written documents or research in dreams?) with two arms holding out like a bird and one leg raised in front, upright position is fine (on reality) it should actually be flat position, kind of childish, kind of strange to the outsider - this is a dedication to his great contribution to the field. (Record available under P9://Digital Assets/Blender named &quot;20230102 Concept Sketchbook.blend&quot;)</p>
<p>There are dedicated facilities for various functions of dream research and sleep research. The campus dedicated to dream research and sleep research is a sprawling complex spread across 90 acres of land. The campus is nestled in the midst of lush green gardens and endowed with state-of-the-art research facilities. The main research buildings have modern architecture (a lot of which are designed by Tao Ye himself or his architecture teams/firms) and are equipped with the latest technologies to support cutting-edge research.</p>
<p>Some of the buildings on the campus dedicated to dream research and sleep research include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Sleep and Dream Research Lab - This research facility is equipped with sleep chambers, EEG machines, and other equipment to monitor sleep patterns and brain activity during sleep.</li>
<li>The Neuroscience Research Building - This building is dedicated to the study of the brain and how it functions in relation to sleep and dreams. It houses advanced MRI machines, EEG technology, and specialized laboratories for genetic research.</li>
<li>The Sleep Disorders Clinic - This facility is designed for both research and clinical practice related to sleep disorders. It includes treatment rooms, consultation rooms, and a dedicated laboratory for sleep apnea research.</li>
<li>The Sleep Wellness Center - This building is focused on promoting healthy sleep habits and improving sleep quality. It houses a variety of tools and resources, such as light therapy stations, relaxation rooms, and therapy services.</li>
<li>The Dream Archives - This unique library and archive collects and preserves dreams from around the world. It includes digitized versions of dream journals, audio recordings of dream diaries, and a vast collection of dream-related literature.</li>
<li>The Dream Interpretation Center - This facility provides services for interpreting dreams and analyzing dream patterns. It is staffed by trained therapists and psychologists who specialize in dream analysis.</li>
<li>Public kitchen and dinning area - Food is provided on-premise for all researchers and students with a small charge.</li>
</ol>
<p>The campus is designed to support a collaborative environment to promote interdisciplinary research related to sleep and dreams. With its cutting-edge facilities and resources, it is a hub of activity in the field of sleep and dream research.</p>
<h2 id="dream-miningdream-thefting">Dream Mining/Dream Thefting</h2>
<p>Dream Mining is the next level of conscious control of dream consciousness to utilize it as a platform or simulation environment, beyond basic skills of astral projection or lucid dreaming/phasing.</p>
<p>Concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's say you are designing a product - you typically don't know how it actually feels untill you have the physical product implemented, but that's going to take forever. Say a hardware device or a game; However, if you can play with it first-handed in a dream, you know how it feels already when you wake up. (This is what happend with Submersion V1.0)</li>
<li>(Legend) Because of the Submersive Technique used by Dream Masters for product design - the legend has it such masters produce products that are flawless and with exceptionally confined scopes. Another feature is that their Time-to-Market of hardware products are usually much shorter than othets. (Think in terms of Apples before Steve Jobs died)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fundamental-lessons">Fundamental lessons</h3>
<p>Most of the training takes time and happens during waking time; There are some training that requires &quot;breakthroughs&quot; in dreams but it's mostly harvesting the results of conscious time training.</p>
<ol>
<li>Drawing (mostly eyeing based and structurally based)</li>
<li>Structural studies (super important!)</li>
<li>3D modeling</li>
<li>Pattern studies</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="theories">Theories</h3>
<p>&quot;The authors discuss how creativity in dreams could stem from &quot;conscious access to the contents of our unconscious minds&quot;; access to &quot;tacit knowledge&quot;—the things we know but can't explain, or things we know but are unaware that we know.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="techniques">Techniques</h3>
<ul>
<li>Priming: Consciously remind and force subconscious to focus on certain subjects - all it takes is a 念头 when done properly</li>
<li>Conditioning: Trigger-based conscious and subconscious training</li>
<li>Thieving: A combination of cosncious-time recording techniques enables efficient memory recall</li>
<li>Lucid Dream: Become conscious in dream</li>
<li>Phasing: Enter the dream/astral world consciously</li>
<li>Watching: Passively let subconscious do all the work, a few other important skills/techniques based entirely on this</li>
<li>Dream Machine/Brain Learning: Learning and application only in subconscious world with no involvement of conscious mind and will not be used during waking times; This usually demands HUGE data memorization during waking time and digesting and reviewing such data in sleeping time - then trigger predictions; This is especially effective against seemingly random patterns, useful in military strategies and behavior learning/prediction; This is also useful in studying a new species/group of people by observing (without understanding their language) and predicting their behaviors; This can also produce prophecies through studying the history and predicting the future; This method (like machine learning) suffers from inexplinability - meaning the predictions can't be logically explained.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="protection-of-classics">Protection of Classics</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;禁忌之术&quot; (or simply too difficult and hard and can potentially mess up with beginners' daily sleep cycle and mental state) are in protected sections of the library - if arbitary &quot;rules&quot; of the regulation and knowledge access is imposed (e.g. only higher members can access), then this becomes a dogma, and then it becomes a taboo, and then it adds intransparancy/mystery to this and make it a big deal. <!--Depending on what kind of atmoshere we want to shape, we can impose such arbitary human-made rules and rituals; As an example, both Whisper schools and TLO should NOT generally pose limits on knowledge access; But due to the nature of dream-based training, sometimes NOT KNOWING can be essential to easy, straightforward and distraction free training. From that regard, even **the full potentials of dream training are hidden to avoid distracting new members** - only those who are able to do it knows the existence of such skills. So the Dream Institute is a very mysterious place: lots of people's success are related to it, but the general public don't know which specific components belong to it; Also new enrolment selection can put a speecial demand on those who are already akin to dreams and have absurd obsessive ambitions.--><!--(Story, Plot) The outside world can attempt to steal it.--></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Effect) One special about TI/恍惚状态 and Redream, that's very different from brainstorming, inspirational ideas, is the nature of such images are post-factual (后天现实). This grants a layer of spiritual/religious authenticity if one pursue it this way.</li>
