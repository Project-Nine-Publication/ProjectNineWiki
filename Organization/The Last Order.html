<p>The human species, through the instrument of culture, has become the dominant force of planetary ecological change. Our adaptations have become maladaptive. Moreover, the human species as a whole now displays all four major characteristics of a malignant process: rapid, uncontrolled growth; invasion and destruction of adjacent normal tissues (ecosystems); metastasis (distant colonization); and dedifferentiation (loss of distinctiveness in individual components). We have become a malignant ecopathologic process. If this diagnosis is true, what is the prognosis? The difference between us and most forms of cancer is that we can think, and we can decide not to be a cancer. - Has the human species become a cancer on the planet? A theoretical view of population growth as a sign of pathology, W M Hern. (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12291996/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12291996/</a>)</p>

<p>It started as some sort of clubs/groups: where people can make 15min appointments asking highly specialized/technical questions. It gathers scientists and experts across fields and make them accessible to each other. Those domain experts are the associates, while regular members are paid members. It's said that the TLO groups can reach more impactful intellects than those 智囊团 from the government for it's highly priviledous (prestigous?). A Delegator role is someone who's polymath and generally understands all fields and can delegate requests to best people to answer.</p>
<p>(Some may classify this as a religion/cult, but here we classify it as organization for now)</p>
<p>Conceptualized and formalized by Tao Ye following the will of The Writer (CZ) after the inspirational event (aka. the death) of Kirin (maybe a more personal event would be the near-death experience of himself); It used to be just a personal/naive cult when he was young (before the funding of NFC) - or an idea that's been nurturing since then.</p>
<p>As a new religion, it has three notable things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The reputation proceeds it in the sense that it's notorious for its messy sexual relationship between members</li>
<li>The reputation proceeds it in the sense of very very bizarre moral values hold by the members</li>
<li>The reputation proceeds it in the sense that lots of members are very very high profile individuals, who happens to choose a solitude life</li>
<li>As led by one of the core members/leaders, aka. Tao Ye, the applicable and research of Dream - albeit not a necessary practice for all members - have legendary impacts on the research and landscape of dream applications, it's said that Tao Ye himself is able to obtain some super-natural experience from it (besides the well-known claim that as a famous architect Tao Ye claims to obtain and conduct most of its ideas and experiments in his dreams)</li>
</ol>
<p>Notable Values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anti-work: Work is a waste of time, especially in the era of computers. All those things should be automated and &quot;maximize return&quot; is just a Pipedream: investment, news, construction.</li>
<li>Anti-children</li>
<li>Anti-intercourse, not anti-sexual-behavior</li>
<li>Anti-marriage</li>
</ul>
<p>Notable practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Dream</li>
<li>Sex &amp; Moral Practices</li>
<li>Very rich entrepreneurships and lifestyles</li>
</ul>
<p>Branches (Based on Fundamental Interpretations/Practices):</p>
<ul>
<li>One branch that derives from the interpretation of active dreaming claims waking life serves the moment of lucidity and one can live an entire reality through his lucid dreams.
<ul>
<li>Actually the company Dreamscape might be very instrumental in studying behaviors of dreams since direct visualization provides much more evidence than guessing from EOG or EEG measures.</li>
