<blockquote>
<p>The human species, through the instrument of culture, has become the dominant force of planetary ecological change. Our adaptations have become maladaptive. Moreover, the human species as a whole now displays all four major characteristics of a malignant process: rapid, uncontrolled growth; invasion and destruction of adjacent normal tissues (ecosystems); metastasis (distant colonization); and dedifferentiation (loss of distinctiveness in individual components). We have become a malignant ecopathologic process. If this diagnosis is true, what is the prognosis? The difference between us and most forms of cancer is that we can think, and we can decide not to be a cancer. - Has the human species become a cancer on the planet? A theoretical view of population growth as a sign of pathology, W M Hern. (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12291996/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12291996/</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Some may classify this as a religion/cult, but here we classify it as organization for now)</p>
<p>Conceptualized and formalized by Tao Ye following the will of The Writer (CZ) after the inspirational event (aka. the death) of Kirin (maybe a more personal event would be the near-death experience of himself); It used to be just a personal/naive cult when he was young (before the funding of NFC) - or an idea that's been nurturing since then.</p>
<p>As a new religion, it has three notable things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The reputation proceeds it in the sense that it's notorious for its messy sexual relationship between members</li>
<li>The reputation proceeds it in the sense of very very bizarre moral values hold by the members</li>
<li>The reputation proceeds it in the sense that lots of members are very very high profile individuals, who happens to choose a solitude life</li>
<li>As led by one of the core members/leaders, aka. Tao Ye, the applicable and research of Dream - albeit not a necessary practice for all members - have legendary impacts on the research and landscape of dream applications, it's said that Tao Ye himself is able to obtain some super-natural experience from it (besides the well-known claim that as a famous architect Tao Ye claims to obtain and conduct most of its ideas and experiments in his dreams)</li>
</ol>
<p>Notable Values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anti-work: Work is a waste of time, especially in the era of computers. All those things should be automated and &quot;maximize return&quot; is just a Pipedream: investment, news, construction.</li>
<li>Anti-children</li>
<li>Anti-intercourse, not anti-sexual-behavior</li>
<li>Anti-marriage</li>
</ul>
<p>Notable practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Dream</li>
<li>Sex &amp; Moral Practices</li>
<li>Very rich entrepreneurships and lifestyles</li>
</ul>
<p>Branches (Based on Fundamental Interpretations/Practices):</p>
<ul>
<li>One branch that derives from the interpretation of active dreaming claims waking life serves the moment of lucidity and one can live an entire reality through his lucid dreams.
<ul>
<li>Actually the company Dreamscape might be very instrumental in studying behaviors of dreams since direct visualization provides much more evidence than guessing from EOG or EEG measures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Last Order 末者会 (Comment, #20230917) Always remembered it as such. Sounds good.</li>
<li>中文名 末日秩序 (idea from) 20230916 walk and chat with Cai YuHong.</li>
<li>Publicly known only as the &quot;Golden Circle Society&quot; - only privately known as The Last Order. Officially and as a registered NGO/religion, the registered name is Opuatio (from Medalian &quot;Perfection&quot; + Latin &quot;organizatio&quot;) 奥帕提奥/欧帕提.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="archetypes">Archetypes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Very rich and delicate lifestyles: LDS (Latter-Day Saints)</li>
<li>Meditation practices: Tibetan Buddhism</li>
<li>Dream practices: As far as we know, no real-world entities has creative-oriented dream practices as we do</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="symbol">Symbol</h2>
<p>We may associate the official symbol to Ouroboros, or make Gao Cong's derivative use that. Because those two (a perfect circle vs 衔尾蛇) are actually quite different. It could work, for the general symbol is a &quot;constructive framework and allows anything that's circular in form&quot;, and followers are free to interpret and decide their own badges.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Symbolism) We definitely want to avoid any existing negative connotations with the symbol of The Last Order (a golden ring) - so far it seemed there is no well-established symbolic meaning for it (besides the gold  ring for marriage) and we are good. Here are a few other potential interpretations we find: the urge for certainty per &quot;Greek&quot; culture, also related to &quot;God Chronos&quot; (<a href="https://www.baunat.com/en/under-the-spell-of-the-gold-ring-engagement-rings-on-finger">https://www.baunat.com/en/under-the-spell-of-the-gold-ring-engagement-rings-on-finger</a>); commitment in marriage. Oh, did I mention that members of TLO who wear a real gold ring in their middle finger are anti-marriage?</li>
<li>(Design) The symbol of TLO might be desgiend related to this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism</a> (The circled dot symbol) Well, our circle is very similar, but can we some how make it more like a circled dot😂 E.g. a large thicker outer circle with a thinner inner circle at 1/3 place, with 12 thin golden lines connecting the two. (History, Philosophy) Either way, the wearer of that symbol should indicate a belief in Panthism and Monism. (Comment) Similar philosophicla/political attributions that can be related and raised as discussions of what TLO followers do include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_green_environmentalism#Dark_greens,_light_greens_and_bright_greens">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_green_environmentalism#Dark_greens,_light_greens_and_bright_greens</a> (Comment, #20230806) Notice originally we conceived the circle as representing &quot;purity&quot; and &quot;perfection&quot;, not as &quot;diversification&quot;.</li>
<li>The Ring: Any circular form confirming to diameter ratio of 1/e is TLO. Members can customize at will and of often do. The single canonical ones are the pure colored un defactaled perfect forms of various colors (goden, red, blue).</li>
<li>Some famous people with ring customizations: 1) Catherine: Flying Ring; 2) Tao Ye: Medalian Circular Form Engraving.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="practices">Practices</h2>
<p>(Might be only certain schools) Freedom to not eat. (idea from, #20240119) Warren's new interpretation on fasting.</p>
<h2 id="ritual">Ritual</h2>
<p><em>Commitment</em></p>
<ul>
<li>(The Last Order, tradition) Individuals have very little &quot;lingering&quot; attachments to this world - they may love and attach when they were committed to, but being able to quickly 释怀 is a quality that's trained and ultimately obtained by every one. Members of the last order <strong>commit suicide</strong> to end their lives whenever they see no longer need to live - even if one wishes so, life must end one way or another, ideally causing as little trouble to others as possible: when they get old, when they are no longer able to take care of themselves, when they went completely bankrupt, when they have reached their lifegoal, when they are bored, when they can no longer recover from a significant disease or the cost is simply too high or not worth it. They often ask friends and other members of the Order to help them do 善后 activities. There is a saying: &quot;we don't get to chose how we come, but we can make the decision how we wish to die - and do it while you still can, and make it magnificent and beautiful.&quot; Some TLO members call themselves &quot;artist of death&quot;, and they compete to create the best death (scene and achievement wise) as possible. (idea from) What's the point of that last 5 years of bothering your children if you could and have already taken care of yourself for the past 75 years? How stupid is “养儿养老&quot; in the modern world where medicine and financial situation and starving shouldn't be an issue for a well-fed and decently grown person?</li>
<li>(Culture) Rituals of TLO are spoken in an ancient branch of Medalian, aka. all members either learn or memorize medalian based 祷文 (sorta like Buddhism in China).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sleeping Away</em></p>
<p>Considered as inheritage from the Chinna-Style 禅宗: They can train themselves, and when it's the right time, they can voluntarily fall asleep without breathing and kill themselves. (idea from) How we sometimes when fixed on ideas momentarily forgot to breathe - even while sleeping. Maybe this can be carried further. It's a very calm state though. Works just like distraction - instead of letting breathing be automatically controlled, you control it, but you forgot to do it when thinking about something else. And there is no pain in such death. It's kind of like a blending of 恍惚状态—— visualize some very slow motion, like falling sands. But you know, since you are technically falling asleep (since it's 恍惚状态), it's actually not &quot;imagining&quot; but more &quot;seeing&quot;. (Very hard to describe, not something similar to conscious experience)</p>
<p><em>贤者模式</em></p>
<p>Ritual (branch) 贤者模式（别人看来乱性），通往神性之门。关键是仪式性、概念性，而不是场面本身。这种贤者模式对普通人是很容易练习的。我们要做的是铺垫理论基础，给性赋予新的意义。</p>
<p><em>Wishes</em></p>
<p>Instead of doing the three-step process, we can do it in a non-superstitious way - light a candle, make a wish, blow it. (Per our my.all diary 20230805 discussion with Charlotte)</p>
<p><em>Death Wish/Death Depature: Faravu</em></p>
<p>Ritual (Enterprise) Faravu: A ship, automated gun actor, drop to ocean, auto-clean.</p>
<p>(It's an enterprise exclusive to TLO members, on a ship, and the ritual and the ship is called &quot;Faravu&quot;)</p>
<h2 id="buildings-architecture">Buildings &amp; Architecture</h2>
<p><em>先决礼堂</em></p>
<ul>
<li>(Culture, Location, #特写) 先决礼堂 (Pending English Name) - the biggest celebration of one's life. Unlike how in the western world (as it seemed), marriage certainly is NOT the situation where you invite a large group of people you rarely know and call it a big celebration, treat everything a dinner - or in China this can also happen if it's one's birthday or other situations. At CofN, chosen/spontaneous death is one's biggest celebration: 1) There will be choir singing (relevant 歌颂篇章; There should be bands and brands just do services creating original songs like these), 2) There will be speaker annoucing a person's achievements in his life, 3) There will be huge family gathering, 4) There will be invitation to everyone the Gifter knows or is close enough to be invited; 5) All neighbours will receive an invitation; 6) There is this big and glorious Church (likely non-Christian) that's dedicated to hosting such events (like churches in the western world host marriage); 7) There will be an absolutely beautiful (and can be sad) ritual; 8) There will be a feast afterwards with celebrations and the reading of wills. ¶It's not too much to see that some people prepare their whole life for this: the achievements, the savings, and etc. The Churches actually belong to and is managed by <strong>The Temple of the Last Order</strong>, and also people can enroll in <strong>The Volunteer Departing Program</strong> so if they don't have enougn savings, The Temple of The Last Order will sponsor their events (likely asking sponsorships from other companies that provide catering etc. as an implicit form of advertisement). (Terminology, Proposal) We will work on this and propose a better word but at the moment we can all this event: sarriage (as save/reborn + marriage) (or mouriage, from french mourir + age, although we probably want it to have more meaningful connotations like &quot;marry&quot;), in a similar form to &quot;marriage&quot;. (idea from) How in that Prison Break the electrocute chair prcedural is just creepy and not comforting at all for someone who's going to die. (Reference) There are some cultures that celebrate death so we might refer to it: <a href="https://www.joincake.com/blog/celebration-of-death/">https://www.joincake.com/blog/celebration-of-death/</a> (Medala) Medalian people don't mourn death but they don't celebrate death either - it's just something happens. However from a cultural perspective this kind of &quot;no-action-nothing-ness&quot; is less interesting than having some events to do associated with it (like &quot;make a big deal out of it&quot; kind of altitude).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Temple of The Last Order 末者神殿</em></p>
<ul>
<li>(Building, #Development, Specification) Temple of The Last Order 末者神殿: Designed by Tao Ye, funded by Tao Ye and many others. Since they don't believe in any particular god nor bind to any particular culture or individuals, and since they still must have gigantous sculptures in those greek-like stoney structures, they will simply MAKE UP LEGENDS, contribute to the <strong>NFC Mythology Universe</strong>, or otherwise use symbolic human figures (like Civilization VI's sculpture, or the sculpture in London Ministry of Magic in Harry Potter).</li>
<li>There is one and only Temple of the Last Order, it's the sacred place where most of the classics are stored</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="practices-1">Practices</h2>
<p>Includes practices of different branches. Might consider categorize based on branch.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Last Order - X (Extremists): Love is poisonous and make people weak, addicted, dependent. No committed love; Contractual long-term sexual relationship is permitted and encouraged. (Charles and other 长老, hoody figure impression)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Name, translation, religion, secret society, The Last Order, Tao Ye) The Last Order: 末者会。 By the way the circle ring symbol means infinite peace. It also symbolize life and nature, whose meaning is subject to interpretation. &quot;I shall be the last.&quot;/&quot;Let us be the last.&quot; &quot;I invite you all to my secret society - The Last Order, where we celebrate the gifts of our nature without restriction under one and only requirement, that we will stop this feast at our generation.&quot;
<ul>
<li>We believe that the eternal peace to the nature is the gradual phasing out of mankind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(The Last Order) Highly against the concept of marriage - &quot;the way I see it, the act is inherently political&quot;. &quot;不婚主意&quot; —— Variation: 无性（性交、双性）主义 (the weaker form allows masturbation using sexual materials - thoughts are Ok; the stronger form prohibits masturbation with sexual materials, but permits using sexual toys)。</li>
<li>(The Last Order, Religion, Discussion, Technical, Analysis) Writing a manuscript took about a year or so but is NOT the most difficult part to create a religion. We need a leader, someone who is a little bit crazy and ideally already have some influence on a group of people. We need a person who is devoted to giving speeches, demonstrate the practice, and broadcast values. That way a religion can grow. ¶Throughout this process it's expected the development of the later form of the religion is NOT going to be as that described by the manuscript but subject to various layers of interpretation.</li>
<li>(The Last Order) Slogan: &quot;The end of all ends.&quot; (idea from) When talking about jobs and getting things done - &quot;there is no end&quot; - &quot;Yes, there is an end, there is always a end&quot;.</li>
<li>(The Last Order, Moral Construction, Quote) &quot;Life has no-no point.&quot; (生命就是毫无意义) - Deeper Propositions. (A possible and thus randomly chosen derived shallow proposition is: The purpose of life is to seek enjoyment.)
<ul>
<li>We believe that the eternal/ultimate peace to the nature is the gradual phasing out of mankind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Religion, mock, joke, The Last Order, Redream, Fragment, Dialogue, #20210818) &quot;God (perTLO) wants people not to have sex - this is not the same (e.g. Christianity) as havibg people having to come to a place built containing his image and people coming here every week.&quot; (idea from) Redream. This is a joke saying how why some people don't like such a fictional religion - however in reality this statement is oversimplification, because religions are more powerful.</li>
<li>(Technical development notes) We can develop TLO's philosophy, and our Moral Construction in term, based on Ethics (by Spinoza). (Most realistically, we might draw ideas from a variety of sources, including Buddhism classics and modern philosophy and EDI/Equity-Diversity-Inclusion ideas - notably, Philosophy of Sex from UofT)</li>
