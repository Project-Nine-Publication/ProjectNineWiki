<p>Original funders: Tao Ye, Vince Fan.
Vince Fan was a statistician and Tao Ye was a polymath whose name comes up in many fields.</p>
<p>Dreamscape is a large corporation (although I am not sure what kind of business would it have to attract such huge amounts of revenue - typically in our worlds retailers and social media companies or commerce companies are the ones that can have significant earnings) that specializes in producing &quot;dream-capture&quot; devices that allows a person to capture and playback their dreams as video signals. The general mechanism of these kind of hardwares are that they form a statistical correlation (latter this is mostly achieved with deep learning models) between a person's vision and the physical capture of their surroundings (through a camera). Originally (like many great inventions) it started as a garage project. The company was funded and located in NFC, residing in rent office towers.</p>
<p>Below are two of the most notable iterations of their hardware:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the early generations, the dream capture device (pending a catchy name) requires users to train using their own perceptions by wearing the device during day time to fine-tune their hardwares.</li>
<li>The latter (state-of-art) models utilizes the latest machine learning (deep learning) technologies/architectures that trains on abundance of real-world vision-neurological data and enables it to be &quot;zero-shot&quot;: it requires only the user to wear it for a few minutes to fine-tune the correlation parameters of the model and will work well automatically afterwards.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some additional ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The company might own (or be owned as) a subsidiary that specializes in medical devices that enables blind people to see again through specialized devices.</li>
<li>The company needs to rely on very advanced and detailed neurological capturing device Dreamwave Scanner (a kind of sensor) to monitor brain activities (mostly visual cortex).</li>
<li>In terms of the medical science aspect, they also created/purchased a company that specializes in producing special-purpose glasses that enables people with blindness to see again (although this technology is different from passive monitoring of neurological signals since it involves INJECTING neurological stimulations instead, so it's less mature).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="company-history">Company History</h2>
<p>(Generated with ChatGPT)</p>
<p>2011: Tao Ye and Vince Fan founded Dreamscape, a small garage project, for the purpose of exploring the possibility of capturing dreams and storing them as visual signals. The company secured funding from both founders and began working on an early generation dream-capture device.</p>
<p>2012-2014: The first-generation device was released, although it required extensive training, calibration, and customization before it could reliably capture and store dreams. The device relied on user inputs throughout the day to fine-tune its parameters, which was time-consuming for users but nevertheless succeeded in creating a buzz in the market. Dreamscape starts partnering with various mental health organizations and research centres, which allowed the company to gather data that accelerated the development of better models.</p>
<p>2012: Dreamscape was featured in Wired magazine for their innovative dream-capture device, garnering attention in the tech world.</p>
<p>2014: The New York Times published an article highlighting the challenges of using the first-generation dream-capture device and the potential benefits of the technology for mental health research.</p>
<p>2015-2019: The company developed a revolutionary deep learning algorithm that allowed the dream-capture device to train and calibrate on its own, reducing the amount of time users needed to invest in the process. This, along with the device becoming more compact and user-friendly, led to a skyrocketing of successful sales for Dreamscape. The company broadened its horizons, creating a subsidiary that focused on technology to enable blind individuals to see. It marked the beginning of their efforts to break the boundaries that separate neurology and engineering, a focus that lasted till date.</p>
<p>2016: CNBC covered Dreamscape's expansion into the blind-technology market, highlighting their commitment to using technology to enhance human capabilities.</p>
<p>2019: The Verge reported on Dreamscape's deep learning algorithm and its impact on making the dream-capture device more user-friendly and effective.</p>
<p>2020 - present day: Further innovations in the dream-capture device paved the way for automatic calibration through a few minutes of calibration when the device was first used, making it even more user-friendly. The video signals captured from the dreamscape hardware are being used to inform different lines of inquiry, for instance, to increase worker productivity, enhance our understanding of mental health and neurology, and, more importantly, spur other applications like VR and AR. Dreamscape continued to grow and expand, opening more branches in different parts of America and overseas due to the success of their flagship product.</p>
<p>2021: Forbes featured an interview with Dreamscape's founders, discussing their vision for the future of neurotechnology and their plans to expand globally.</p>
<p>2022: The company celebrated its tenth anniversary with the launch of something larger than merely a new product or feature. They had, through years of research and development, integrated neuroscience with AI and neurotechnology; they reimagined the possibility of human consciousness by developing a fully integrated, advanced brain-computer interface. Dreamscape unleashed a highly ambitious project inspired by the likes of Neuralink by Elon Musk. Dreamscape has already obtained regulatory approval to launch a massive, global clinical trial involving thousands of participants covering different demographics.</p>
<p>2022: The launch of Dreamscape's brain-computer interface project received widespread coverage in the tech and neuroscience communities, with publications such as TechCrunch and Science Magazine reporting on the potential impact of the technology on human consciousness and cognitive abilities. The company also faced scrutiny and concerns regarding privacy and data protection with the release of this advanced technology.</p>
<p>2023: Dreamscape expands its product line to include a software platform that allows users to upload, share, and browse their dreams on the cloud. The platform is called Dreamshare. The company also creates a subsidiary specifically dedicated to managing the social media platform called Dreamshare Inc. It also started construction of its new headquarter at downtown NFC.</p>
<p>2024: Dreamshare gains millions of users worldwide, becoming one of the most popular social media platforms globally. This leads to increased revenue for Dreamscape, and the company invests heavily in artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to further enhance the Dreamshare platform. Dreamshare also released a major upgrade allow easy editing and enhancement of user-created videos with AI technologies.</p>
<p>2025: Dreamscape announces a partnership with a major technology firm to integrate the Dreamshare platform with virtual and augmented reality devices. This allows users to experience their dreams in a fully immersive environment, bringing the dream-capture technology to a new level.</p>
<p>2026: Dreamscape receives criticism from privacy advocates due to concerns over the storage and use of users’ personal dream data. The company responds with substantial changes to its data storage and privacy policies, ensuring greater transparency and control for users.</p>
<p>2027: In response to the popularity of Dreamshare and the growing demand for dream-capture technology, Dreamscape expands its research and development operations, opening new labs and hiring top scientific talent. The company continues to lead the field of dream-capture technology and brain-computer interfaces, solidifying its position as a global leader in the industry.</p>
