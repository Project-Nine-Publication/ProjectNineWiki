title Inception of Concept
    201?: Mom mentioned name for company.
    2024: Remembered and considered merging with earlier impression at primary school
</pre>
<p>Archetype: Pending</p>
<p>Inspiration: (2024) We could merge this concept with our high-tech under-dog style 黑道少年公子、黑道少年文化 primary school concept into this, where this gang has some serious high-tech and remove communication technology and this young princess has power. (Pending investigating what kind of social environment nurtures this) (Remark) His father could be one of those early ones who PERSONALLY (without other illegal appraoch) get appraoched or accessed Medalians during &quot;the first contact&quot; and thus gained access to some serious technoloygy - while government bans it. But this gang doesn't really do illegal stuff, it's more like a government-free vigillante.</p>
