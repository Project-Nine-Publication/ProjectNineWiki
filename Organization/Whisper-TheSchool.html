            <h1>Whisper - The School</h1>
<p>Whisper is a multi-functional university, and spiritual descendent of the original VMA school at Vandentra. It's a full-spectrum/holistic boarding school, research institute and educational and labour certification instution inside NFC. It is considered one of the highest educational facility in NFC and even across the world. Though due to the way it operates and some of the controversies, Whisper is certainly not ranked among other traditional educational institutions.</p>
<p>At the very beginning, Whisper was the private institution set up by the Medala people to communicate and exchange culture and education with the Tellus people. Historically, such institutions are not limited to a single place - different cities have different forms of such exchanges albeit similar functions. The &quot;Whisper&quot; that we talk about refers specifically to the former and later reformed complex inside NFC. After (the war), various VMAs are decommissioned, and Mr. Leng/Tao Ye re-established Whisper at NFC to 纪念 that period. The overall organization scheme and teaching style of Whisper is already very different from the original VMA style because Tao Ye (the chief education and architecture architect) brought lots of new (and somewhat more aggresive) ideas into the school.</p>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>Whisper in NFC serves three main functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>General purpose multi-functional university just like any other university in the world.</li>
<li>A dedicated training path in the form of a boarding school that provides a &quot;elite-like&quot; education for certain participants; This is manged under the Thyila College (from Thyïlea, or Thule).</li>
<li>A standardization and certification organization for labour services, managed under the Department of Labour Certifications.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, as the hub for innovation and a place that embraces rich traditions despite a short history, the school of Whisper can be seem to have the following other functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>A tourist attraction</li>
<li>A symbol of the not-so-distant Medalian inheritage</li>
<li>A test bed of cultural reforms and leading research opportunities</li>
</ol>
<p>Whisper is half private half public half NFc government supported (there might be management issues from this hybrid role but we will deal with it latter), in such that it has priviledges that's not granted to other universities. For instance, certain research subjects are only legally allowed within the ground of Whisper, not any other places.</p>
<h2 id="location">Location</h2>
<p>There are four main sites of Whisper within NFC:</p>
<ol>
<li>The original site containing the original legacy twin tower buildings, within one of the main business districts of NFC, located inside a large garden area in south-east NFC. This is considered the main campus for a majority of activities.</li>
<li>A large facility for all kinds of research and operations within the northern mountain range of NFC.</li>
<li>A few other colleges that scattered around the south-west coast of the city of NFC. Including the architecture academy.</li>
<li>Far north into the mountains there is a radio telescope and astronomy research facility owned and operated by Whisper including ongoing communication with resilient Medalian expedition teams.</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally speaking, Whisper is at the neighbourhood of but not within the center of usual city business activities to keep it less clustered and distracted by busy city life. There are a few other properties owned by the instution (including independant research facilities and a large hospital) including a large mansion within the northern mountain range.</p>
<h2 id="buildings">Buildings</h2>
<p>Whisper's building allocations followed two different trends and there are thus two directions of building allocations, the first one is how things used to work when Whisper was a smaller campus (more like a high school), this is one is now deprecated, the second one treats the school more like a university with specialized departments. In the original scheme buildings were managed under specialized management teams, under the second regime buildings were managed under departments by subjects and preferrably close together for easier of access. There are two distinct yet connected architectural styles visisble in the campus: one is the more monumental or (Chinese) Forbidden City like solemn look with little plants or organic scenary, represented by the Exam Center, the other is interconnected potted garden with pebble walkways (like in Chinese or Japanese high school) or otherwise small asphalt driveways along side of natural gardens with lots of plotted plants and gardens, symbolized by the 20160707 dream- specially, we will especially apply this kind of setting to the original Twin Tower impression, comtrary to the otherwise &quot;barren&quot; look from the original dream. One feature of Whisper is some places have age and gender restrictions - only younger people or women (or young girls) are allowed, notably The Secret Garden.</p>
<p>High-school like old legacy buildings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twin Tower -&gt; Tri-Tower: Twin Tower -&gt; Tri-Tower is used more like conference center and some special education programs. Also as a museum of past history and interaction with Medala civilization. Owned by the History and Anthropology Department.
<ul>
<li>Surronding the Twin Tower on the ground level is a network of pathways intervined with potted gardens. The walkspace can be used for morning fitness routines for high school students.</li>
<li>It includes a conference hall on one of the floors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Experiment Building: For physics and chemistry labs, managed by Experiments Committe.</li>
<li>The Exam Center 试众堂: managed by the General Administration Center.</li>
<li>Administration Center: A building and also a department.</li>
<li>Main Auditorium: for student-organized events and activities - theater, music, and other performance-based activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specialized Buildings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whisper Botanical Garden and Botanical Experimentation Ground: Managed by the Biology Department.</li>
<li>The Whisper Cafeteria (PENDING NAME): Managed by Foods and Culture Department.
<ul>
<li>May consult dream 20160707</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>General Purpose Buildings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gym: Sports Center, managed by Sports and Acrobatics department.</li>
<li>Library 1 (PENDING NAME): Managed by Library Committe.</li>
<li>Library 2 (PENDING NAME): Managed by Library Committe.</li>
<li>Library 3 (PENDING NAME): Managed by Library Committe.</li>
<li>Front Campus Playground: Managed by School Gardens Committe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Residence Areas: Managed by School Residence Committe (or maybe specific colleges like at UofT)</p>
<ul>
<li>Trilogy Tower: Aggregate complex and research center with a residential focus. With its own cafe, labs, and library. Hosts a few hundred people. 20% researchers and 80% students. 50% males and 50% females.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other Notable Amendities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Open Opera: Small amphitheater open space partially surronded by tall bushes, with the other open half close to the walkway. There is also a peristyles walkway/corridor nearby (may or may not connect to a small lotus pond if there is water source nearby).
<ul>
<li>Per dream 20160707; This is also near the outdoor swimming poor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Outdoor swimming poor (named &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;): Owned and managed by Girls' Only Swimming Poor committe. (Yes, girls, not &quot;woman&quot;; This is a dedication and an honoration for girls)
<ul>
<li>Guys are indeed permitted, but no males over the legal age of consent in NFC - that is, this place is exclusively for young girls and boys and maybe adult women but not adult men. Only men charged with the duties of cleaning and other official duties may come here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="anti-specialization">&quot;Anti-Specialization&quot;</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The world is more specialized than ever, and the trend will only continue; Generalists will be rarer. Soon no one will be able to know all the truths.&quot; - Tao Ye</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 20s the great leader (headmaster?) of Tao Ye <!--(Remark, #20230614) I think it meant the headmaster of the school - thus it's also the headmaster "of Tao Ye". Not that Tao Ye was the headmaster--> made the decision that Whisper should aim not just at interstellar subjects but <em>train for generalization</em>. The &quot;anti-specialization&quot; movement is thus the movement that focuses on letting people know all the fundamental truths of the world. This is assisted with NFC's Certificate based occupation system, in which a person do not need to get a bachelor degree or anything just for the job - instead for schooling they can focus on studying the true knowledge, and for jobs they just need to study for certificates (at leisure time).</p>
<h2 id="institutes">Institutes</h2>
