<p>Zuroqiro is an ancient organization originating from the first space explorers of Medala. In the present it, it dominantes the entire power structures of all political regimes in the greater known galaxy and intefere in things in the most subtle way.
Throughout the generations they are one of the most diverse populations and powerful and secret organization recruiting from all species in the universe. As a secret society, they don't have some well-known large scale settlement and their gathering place is scattered throughout the universe in various cities and they have their own ways of keeping in contact.</p>
<p>Among many other legends, of greater interest is their collection of Portkeys and the rumoured existence of their &quot;treasure room&quot; - Portkey Collection Room.</p>
<p>The concept was originated from Legends of NFC 20231229 &quot;空间旅行&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<p>Some kind of derivation of 特、门罗、我爱罗, etc.</p>
<ul>

<li>Zuroqiro</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>As one of the earliest discoverers of the abundancy of Portkeys, they jump in in time and started gathering all such legendary objects by bribing and trading and hunting and coercing their way throughout civilizaitons to collect all such artifacts.
Each Portkey is somewhat different in both apprent functions and shape.
By distributing (renting) those portkeys with great control, they exhibit tremendous influence on civilizations of all kinds.</p>
<p>Some post-modern civilizations hate them and think the Portkeys are righteously theirs and Zuroqiro just stole from them. But then none can easily prove for only Zuroqiro seems to have better history of each articraft they collect.</p>
