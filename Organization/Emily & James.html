<p>Longest on-going adult animation/feature films.</p>

<p>Big (North america/NFC) adult culture (sex toys) and media entertainment (E&amp;J animation) producer. Specialize in one show specifically: Emily &amp; James. The funder of the company is said to be a couple - but only James (CEO) ever showed up in media, and never has one ever seen Emily. There are some very few selection of sex joys branded after E&amp;J, designed by its own designers. The company focus on in-house production of its toys and animation, and focuses heavily on originality and consistency (in a sense, world building) of its show.</p>
