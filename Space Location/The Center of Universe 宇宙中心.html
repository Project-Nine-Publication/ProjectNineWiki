<p>The universe has a center. There are two meanings to this: There is a geo-political center, or there is a physical center. Since the universe is generally perceived as boundless (even the Fepulans doesn't know what's the center of their universe due to the limit in travel speed) - the center of this universe is not reachable directly through the 3-dimenstional travels. This center is not the geometrical center of the universe - it's the playground for Fepulans players.</p>
<p>(See 20230408 dated treatment on Medalian Hemisphere for more information on the background of Fepulans players)</p>

<li>Due to the accelerated expansion of universe, alon with the speed limit of this universe, causing 94% of universe already lost in our reach (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzkD5SeuwzM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzkD5SeuwzM</a>) - those part of the universe already NO LONGER EXIST in the simulation. This is further evidenced by the fact that our milky way (or the local group) is not that far away from the center of the universe - which is, of course, since everything else has already left there, is re-used as a &quot;ambassador&quot; for the Creator. Notice this is in direct contrast to &quot;island Universes&quot; hypothesis (or a 2D ant hypothesis which assumes a 4D universe), where it claims there is no center for our universe.</li>
