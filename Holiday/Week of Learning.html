<p>It's customary tradition since Queen I (and publication of 天下诏书) that there is a yearly Week of Learning where all walks of life stop their work and learn topics of greater concern: Civic, law, language, major science. Published by government for all ages. The idea is that this way people are informed and great achievements can be inspired from the general public. (The original motivation was that after certain age, the majority of population are dumb and just comfortable with staying as is, and that's why they fear progress and loss of job) This paid holiday is an encouragement but not an enforcement. Great governmental media use is necessary for it to be successful.</p>
<p>The same holiday idea is borrowed by Xia family and observed in NFC, though lasting only 3 days.</p>
