<li>Since the title goes like this, let's use it as a chance to dig some dirt out of NFC: the political corruption, and sexual scandal of some high levels (or is this likely, if Mr. Leng is such a strict person? Maybe this doesn't apply to the political world but more in terms of cultural or other hidden domains?)</li>
<li><strong>Jackie Liu</strong>著，一本Visual Journal —— A compilation of <em>journalism</em>, <em>stories</em> (folktales), <em>photos</em> from Jackie Liu's personal experience into City Nine, with his experience, his introductions and presentations, his photos about many respects of City Nine. Jackie himself is a famous journalist. Jackie Liu其人的人物面貌和萧衎就差别很大了，完全不一样的风格，更像是明珠塔的设计者那样的正派（而没有萧衎的痞气）风格。</li>
<li>《（小说）九层楼志》第一部分的参考原型；这个概念自身也独立发展成单独的书（概念上）</li>
<li>By Topic rather than time；合理；因为是Journal/杂志作者的风格</li>
<li>线索：除了刚进去时楼内外特点对比带来的记录文学之外，后来也随着九层楼时期下楼内事件的发展和相关故事（作为纪实文学作者自然是跟随者当前社会、大众的焦点进行即时的追踪）而展开</li>
<li>Media talk facts. It's hard to tell what is real not because the world is filled with false believes, but the very reality itself is difficult to properly define. Should those which are persistent called &quot;real&quot;, or those that are intensely amusing termed &quot;reality&quot;? The story between the living and the dead is another example of this. When there is nothing in the world that can seem real, what should we trust, or do we simols trust nothing at all but our experience, what about fake experience?
<ul>
<li>Nothing is real, there are simply better models. (Remark, #20211229) I would like to argue that: Experience is real, think Free Guy 2021 - it may be a implicit biological modeling process in our brain, but at least we don't explicitly consider this as a (logical) model. So it's far from truth just saying &quot;nothing is real&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful&quot; (Since model building is the essence of science). By George E. P. Box (1919 – 2013).</li>
