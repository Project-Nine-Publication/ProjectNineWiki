<!--# ProjectNine.CityDesign

Ctiy Design principles, elements, considerations, case studies, management schemes, and historical and phislophical notes on ideal city management, etc.

> Not until you design a city for yourself will you appreciate the complexity of running a living society.

**Overview**

We are not even touching the whole fidelity of **human civilization** and **history of lives**, but just thoughts in terms of an **idealization** of the **best possible conception** of a **city operation model** - allowing things of course such as **crimes** and other **natural elements**. **One** once argued that *whatever exists now is the best possible reality in the world* - this is **true** as it goes for **the reality we live in**, but clearly wrong in terms of **what is possible** from **retrospective** or from the perspective of **human conception**. The fundation for our argument that *the whole idea of such a design of CofN can exist* in the first place is that **there is something in this world/society that we can improve** - and that's all we need to start building our own city.

In this repository we provide a **centralized place** for collecting **notes** and (hopefully) **treatments** on **efficient**, **modern-futuristic**, **oriental**, **romantic**, **environmentally-friendly** and in general a **"better"** city design, including but not limtied to proposed **ctiy design principles** as incorporated in CofN, **elements of city details**, **considerations for design and construction**, **case studies of existing cities and legends and historical cities**, **management schemes**, and **historical and philosophical notes** on ideal city/country management models, etc. What this work is not: 1) It's not **science fiction** or steam punk style imagination; 2) It is heavity based on **reality** and focus on **applicabity** and stresses **engineering scale** whenver possible and intended to be deployed as real city models assuming we can have an infinite amount of power to start a city afresh in an instant.

A city's function is heavitly inspired by **existing functions (e.g. infrastructrues and economy and technology and thinking)** to power the city so this work necessarily builds upon and is motivated by other topics of concern governing the **overall development** of **Project Nine**.-->
<p><strong>Politics Constitution</strong>: Every year Jan and July: a whole month long self organizing all citizen important decision making event. Foods and everything served, all other (lesser important) work paused. Everyone is involved and participated and publicly deal with 6-month worth of all sorts of decision making related matters: lawsuits, etc. Open discussion with panels...</p>
<p><strong>Misc Ideas</strong>: 1) For the poor and the suffered (from outside world and other areas of world), import them rather than providing temporary resource supports. Our city can afford that. 2) 闹市/夜市：Vacancy rate, utilization</p>
<p><strong>Secrets</strong>: 1) The normal lives of Medalians and Krukians are hidden from massive amount sof ordinary citizens, like how Dubai hides the life of the suffered from the enjoying people, 2) The existence of a giant and fast developing Undercity is a huge secret - also related to the geological activities.</p>
<p>Impressions (Pending better categorization): (Idea, NFC, #Impression) 上层：穿着十分讲究（对比东洋现代穿着简单，牛仔T恤）；全体：街道十分干净（受到佛教和当地灵学的影响）。 (Remark, #20230408) I especially like the scene depicted in Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves 2023 High Sun Games gambling hall with those high-status looking elf women.</p>
<p>Dietary Habit: More sweet food (Nanjing)? More salty (China North)? More dumplings and noodles (China North? More quantity over protein (Toronto)? More salty (Toronto Downtown)? There will surely be a wide variety of food, but there will be a default preference when it comes to serving the public.</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<ul>
<li>EnFan City (Engineering Fantasy)</li>
<li>Nine Floor City, New Frontier City, City Nine</li>
<li>Public relationship use (in-world): NFC</li>
<li>Internal codename (in-world): 九层楼 (This term is especially used by the old 元老 designers and their internal circles)</li>
<li>NFC: Non-Fictional City; Ned Furance's Chest.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p>Location: NFC is located on top of a seismic zone, there are regular small and large seismic activities (the building styles and architecture styles should reflect this).</p>
<h2 id="political-system">Political System</h2>
<p>(THIS ENTRY CAN PROBABLY BE ELABORATED INTO: SYSTEM NOTE, ACTUAL DIALOGUE, NFC POLITICAL SYSTEM SUMMARY WRITING) &quot;Some people say NFC is communism, and communism is bad. I will argue it this way: the key to a successful ideology is to make sure it doesn't become the ideology of a single leader. That's why an open source system is all that matter. And here is another point: absolutely nothing last indefinitely, so both the system and all the terms within the system must be able to dynamically adjust. The frequency of adjustment if inverse of the cost.&quot;</p>
<p>NFC uses a randomized approach for making important voting-weighted decisions (the philosophy of which is worth a separate discussion). It uses an algorithm-based approach (the specific generator is very interesting and worth separate treatment) and the algorithm/device design is open source. This applies to a few major civic decisions including Leading Party Generation, Election, among other things. The general approach is this: 1) Let people/participating parties vote, 2) Do a uniform random number generation to select the final win. This way we allow people's opinions to affect final outcome through weights, and let the final decision be decided randomly as a mechanism to cope with human's inherent bias and potential risks of uninformed decisions. This process is highly celebrated and highly respected and of solemn status. It's executed very very seriously and publicly.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>(Politics, System, Project Nine, System Proposal) 相比“代议民主“——可否让NFC是一种”可选“直接民主，即居民可以不通过代表直接参与影响政治决策，但是可选参与。使用数字化方式计算投票权重：1）经济相关性，2）经验相关性。例如一个投票者A对于某个关于话题T的单选决议α的决策投票v的票值取决于α对于A的经济影响（以单体增加和减少来衡量），以及A本身对于T的经验（通过Certificate系统来衡量）。v=∆Cost/TotalCostOfAllParticipants + EXP/TotalEXPOfAllParticipants.</p>
</li>
<li><p>(Landscape, #New) Having Mountains INSIDE the City: It's visually interesting and structurally advantageous - there should be as tall as latitude 150m-400m mountains directly in the city, aka. the city is built on mountains/hills, just like Vancouver/Burnaby. (Pending references, pending dedicated markdown notes for detailing of concepts, Pending QGIS map, pending RTS modeling, pending concept art, pending illustration)</p>
</li>
<li><p>(design, copyright, culture, society, en-fan, feature) （文化，城市特点）九层楼里面很多很多（甚至基本都是？）原生企业，这样以满足自给自足。Notice originally we might say this is avoid conflict of copyright, but later we realize it's actually <strong>necessary</strong> - since CofN needs to be self-sustained, it needs those native/original companies for doing all sorts of things to reduce dependency.</p>
</li>
<li><p>(culture, fashion) 如果说女孩子化妆是为了追求时尚和好看而不是为了吸引男生的话，那么尤其在九层楼这样一种男女平等、女性科学等各方面造诣成就较之男性有过之而无不及的环境中，男孩子化妆和追求时尚至少也是与女孩子相当的规模（即便不是男孩子可以打扮的很花哨来追求女孩子的喜欢）：值得一说是在原先的不适应之后萧衎在九层楼呆久了也会逐渐更为十分的注意起自己的外貌、发型和穿着。男生们在九层楼是很不顾忌的有长发、时装比赛、和艳丽的衣服的。尤其是刚开始感到奇怪的是有些人穿着裆部明显好似垫了一块垫子突出来的紧身裤子萧衎刚开始的时候觉得很难看。(Research) 我们也可以重点渲染描述一下男性化妆的成分和流程，包括现代标准的business装束（主要是头发和穿着等）、以及刻意借用现代女性化的头发、粉底、衣服等元素。</p>
</li>
<li><p>(Civil, GIS) NFC has 4 city halls<!--Ideally we break this down into and according to suburbs-->: <strong>Area 1 City Hall</strong>, <strong>Area 6 City Hall</strong>, <strong>Area 12 City Hall</strong>, and <strong>Area 18 City Hall</strong>. <!--Instead of having city halls, since NFC is likely highly digitalized, why doesn't every one (or every other nearby) area has its own "city-hall" like general public service (like "Service Ontario") center? So instead of calling it "city hall", we call it "NFC Service Center".--></p>
</li>
<li><p>(Question, City, Design) What's the point of real world cities like Toronto Downtown to be so crowded and all the buildings so close together? Why didn't it simply be more spread out in the first place - after all, for any given function a certain radius should be able to satisfy and underground infrastructures won't cost that much.</p>
</li>
<li><p>(NFC) Everything is free for locals: food, grocery. Pick up with your PR. Even jobs are free (like free free) - and hot positions are gone quickly with severe competition. Very rare resources require PR points which are gained with very specific means or jobs. (idea from) Water transports nutrions within our body and cells just take what they want. Though the difference between cells and humans are that cells stay put unless they have special mobile functions. Can we have a system like this, where each one just takes what they need and we have a central transport? Without tight measurements this system is subject to abuse, but with PR, we can indeed do that. (Value) In this system, watching TV might be considered a waste of time because producing consumptions for money is also a waste of time. The system might require that people only do real art and real meaningful stuff. One way to implement this is to provide high standards for reference - limit what truly good contents can show on TV.</p>

<li>(#Management, Methodology, Idea) There is no perfect, nor even an &quot;optimal&quot; city - but only cities that work (with constant patches), and cities that don't work (without constant patches). ¶The lesson for us when designing NFC is, instead of thinking of &quot;the perfect layout/design&quot;, we should instead try &quot;putting as many specific things as needed in first&quot;, then we can gradually optimize it.</li>
<li>(Monument, Idea) 建筑: 纪念碑（of what？！） - Meant to be simple and paramount. It also serves as a landmark, a piece of artistic design, effect of which can only be seen when up front immersively. Refer to G3 photo of Vimy Memorial on 20161230. We can use a spherical floating panel design to represent peace or development or technology. Or simply use a huge animal abstract to represent food itself. As simple as that, because it is only meant to be simple and its sheer size and uniform color brings awe.</li>
<li>(Museum, Idea) War Museum of (Nine): In facing extraordinary changes, warriors' lives shaped our current living. And war isn't fun, but should be a comfortable experience for people to see and remember. (Now this is the important part of education - lots of people in China have baised view regarding wars and think it's exciting etc.) Build a bunch of interactive contents to allow audience to try and face real difficulties/challenges etc. Notice that military culture isn't all about wars: public services, researches and defences, off the land and map reading and first aid and wild living skills etc. (Inspiration) Museums show history and aspects (e.g. of uncommon events)</li>
</ul>

<!--P-->
<ul>
<li>(#Management, Philosophy, Design) Mr. Leng is trying to attract money, resource, intellects and everything else by making this city <strong>a place for everybody</strong> - this is not just limited to people of all (human) races, but also to a large extent (like nowhere else on Earth and nowhere else in the universe or the Medalian World) to the species of all kinds - notably NFC is the only place in the known universe where Miah people can really &quot;get along&quot; with Kruks in the same place. However due to many many layers of conflicts between Miah and Kruks, and between within the factions of Kruks, this world is not a perfectly ideal place. <em>Above ground</em> is the heavily legislated and enforced region for all species, and <strong>Undercity</strong> is a less-managed self-organized conflict-centered places where fights can easily take place (but some Kruks like it this way). To some extent, Undercity is not a symbol of suppression (where Mr. Leng kind of suppress those who live in Undercity and don't allow them to go anywhere), but a place of freedom (where they decide to conform a much less regulations and live things in their own way). By all means, unlicensed use of resources and abusive reproduction of both Miah and Kruks are prohibited. ¶Apparently such an welcoming policy for Kruks causes considerable division between Miah and that's why a large fraction of loyal Medalian people don't follow Mr. Leng and lives in their own isolation (after some agreement) in dedicated regions (R18) of NFC. The point here is that both humans of all races, Miah people, and Kruks (mostly in humanoid forms) can be easily seem in certain workspaces.</li>
</ul>
<!--Q-->
<!--R-->
<ul>
<li>(Region, City, Idea) Either a region of NFC (but be cautious about light pollution) or some other place e.g. an exotic Medalian trading depot - ???，又称不夜城，实行全日制工时（Full-Day Working Hours）——早中晚24hr不论日出日落全行业工作，所以在一个城市具有一般两个城市的人口——分为白日和晚日。房屋隔音隔光效果甚好。(idea from) 2am at downtown Vancouver - there is streelight but barely any passengers. What a waste of such land resources. Shops and merchant spaces can be greatly utilized if it functions during both day and night - as regarding to residential problems I am sure we have ways to accomodate that. But I guess the key question in this case are: 1) Are there enough population/demand/need to support such activities? 2) Are there enough resources to support such activities?</li>
<li>(Region, Mr. Leng, L2) Judging by <em>apparent value</em> - grand sum of all properties of CofN - Mr. Leng is a <em>high value target</em>, as such, he's susceptible to killing/assassination. At the mean while, who will inherit his future value is an unknown factor (so there will be speculations). Normally we would expect there be no high ground (potential locations for marking) near Mr. Leng's residence, but this would not be necessary, instead, sniping-wise speaking, those two strategies are deployed: 1) Everyone near the peripheral of Mr. Leng's residence is <em>continuously tracked</em> and the moment a person pulls out a weapon, Airi will notify corresponding people to handle it; 2) Since Mr. Leng's residence is on the second floor, it's right below the edge of a third-floor land (to get decent lighting while avoiding anyone using 3rd floor as sniping position), and all other lands on the third floor are very far to make sniping practically impossible targeting Mr. Leng's residence. 3) No drones or other airborne transportations are allowed on top of Mr. Leng's residence peripheral. ¶As such, despite Mr. Leng's high value, ordinary people can indeed live near him without having much inconvinience, and there indeed can be 2-3 floor high traditional chinese style constructions near his residence.</li>
<li>(Restaurant, Idea) All you can eat theme park. Sections map available online for study: all foods truly from all.over the word with very specific varieties. Eat and learn and watch and spend all day if you want! 注意饮食安全，不能混吃。(Elaboration) This makes more sense since we had this idea that &quot;if a customer has to order too much and not be able to eat them all then it's the restaurant's fault to provide quantity over variety&quot;, in which case if it's indeed costly for a restaurant to provide varierty over quantity, then maybe it's a good idea to have just such selected few restaurants that are just designed for this purpose so resources are better utilized.</li>
</ul>
<!--S-->
<ul>
<li>(#Management, Strategy) A detailed 2D flat(no dynamic elements) b/w street map can tell a lot of details. See ref Street map of Paris abd it's faubourgs taken 2016123 G3. ¶Notice that in those Western times (e.g. 18 to 19 century) those people.decorate the city and buildings to every corner and the space thus feels cosy and content.(See The conception of Emperor Napoleon and thr coronation of Empress Josephine in December 2, 1804  Shot 20161231 on G.</li>

<h2 id="culture-on-the-manifestation-of-native-religionmythology-cofn-native">(Culture) On &quot;the manifestation of native religion/mythology&quot; (CofN Native)</h2>
<p>At the highest level, e.g. from an anthropological point of view, the &quot;spiritual&quot; world isn't necessarily religious. When we say Tao Ye borrows asian elements into his architectural designs - it necessarily involves those spirits of the asians. Besides, for all practical reasons, it's just interesting to have those smaller elements here and there in the city - not to just &quot;<strong>make a point</strong>&quot; (like as if it's a piece of <em>modern art</em>), but more in the sense of &quot;<strong>making a connection</strong>&quot;. A connection to what, you might ask? A connection to our nature. Imagine a modern world where all things people construct are for practical purposes only - they are very efficient with the use of material and costs, but their design lacks that sense of &quot;人文情怀&quot; - and this is what we mean by &quot;native mythology&quot; - it's partially borrowed beliefs, stories, legends around the world, from ancient mythologies, and it's also in a sense <strong>new fantasies</strong> that are designed to suit the trend of modern societies.</p>
<p>In short, there are 3 major sources (among many others) where those elements are borrowed from:</p>
<ol>
<li>Traditional Taoism, Japanese religion elements, including Buddhism and 禅宗 - those are the animals, sculptures, architecture elements.</li>
<li>Shrines, Mythologies, Gods, Deities - Those are the sculptures, animals, and various other beings from around the world.</li>
<li>Systematic mythology - this is mostly Greek/北欧, and Medalian religions.</li>
</ol>
<p>And here are minor sources:</p>
<ol>
<li>Popular fictions: monsters, characters, objects from games, novels, popular fictions. (Notice all those &quot;fictions&quot; will be original CofN native fictions, not from the modern world outside NFC).</li>
</ol>
<p>The manifestation is seen in the following fashions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Constructions that are <em>singular</em> and used for one particular symbolic or representational meaning - e.g. gateways (The Stone Gates), Sculptures of monsters etc.</li>
<li>Themed constructions in the form of parks, parklets;</li>
<li>Architectural elements in terms of gardens, construction material, construction process, 空间布局, and traditional decoration and utility elements.</li>
<li>The utilization of otherwise &quot;free&quot; or &quot;wasted&quot; space e.g. top of building (which may also be used as public gathering places or other purposes), corners of buildings, corners of streets, and various other lesser visited but nonthless taken-care of places.</li>
<li>The general layout and design of the city itself.</li>
<li>Wall paintings.</li>
<li>AR-identified augmented geo-location information.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice such mythology is NOT manefected in such a fashion which is too boring:</p>
<ol>
<li>Written on name plates, giving credits explicitly for things - a more interesting fashion is to JUST PUT THINGS THERE WITHOUT NAMING/REFERENCING explictly so there is a bit more explorative value. Also don't want to make things look too formal.</li>
</ol>
<p>These mythologies can manefest and appear in those scenarios for practical daily encountering:</p>
<ol>
<li>A completely newly designed constellation system and related stories;</li>
<li>Layout for arbitarily culture-inspired city arrangements (so it's not just scientific, but also culturally inspired) - one way to do this is whenever Tao Ye or architects from that school build a new design, they elaborate a bit more on characters from the Myth and create layouts and elements to suit those: remember, at least in terms of architecture, those buildings are artists playgrounds - highly prestigous, and highly flexible; Residents are usually just occupants that don't own those so this scheme make sense, if they really want something originally, they should persue such a career.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="background-nfc-context-an-overview-of-the-state-of-the-artificial-intelligence-systems-of-nfc">(Background, NFC, Context) An Overview of The State of The Artificial Intelligence Systems of NFC</h2>
<!--Pending recollect to "Technology" catagory-->
<p>Charles first created the first-ever manmade sentimental AI system for personal purpose, named <strong>Airi</strong> - this is a fact. And that system is rule-based, which is legendary on its own. That was the 雏形 which later was evolved into an open-source system named <strong>Eris Core</strong>, the name was partly a joke. Eris Core soon inspired lots of derivations and also new implementations of more advanced <strong>general-AI systems</strong>.</p>
<p>When Mr. Leng found Charles, they had a discussion on the potential of building the entire NFC (political) framework on top of an open platform and on top of an &quot;<em>artificial mastermind</em>&quot; - that gave rise to the official implementation of the later 3 generations (in order of appearance) of <em>Government Use</em> (social-political), <em>Civil Use</em> and <em>Military Use</em> AIs, collectively known as &quot;<strong>The Divine Guardians</strong>&quot;. Those systems are ubiquitous throughout the NFC network, although they do have certain <strong>interface points</strong>, notably in the forms of: <em>OP Programming API</em>, <em>Access Terminals</em> and one or more <em>freely movable robotic body</em> (a rudimentary form of Kruks-like <strong>collectives</strong> behavior, though in human-made cloud/distrubuted-system technology), and they have names: the government use AI is called <strong>Themis</strong>, the civilian AI is called <strong>Hermis</strong>, and the military AI is called <strong>Demis</strong>.</p>
<p>There are many many more intelligent systems in the city, most of which don't even have roots in Charles' systems - notably, ever since <em>the third age of artificial intelligence</em> and the advent of <strong>deep learning systems</strong>, <em>functional artifical intelligent systems</em> are already sprouting everywhere. When Miah visited earth and had trading of technology, general purpose AI agents based on Miah-provided <strong>AI Matrix</strong> is very accessible and actually helped shaped the <strong>Robot Age</strong> where helpful robots can live with humans (an estimate of about 50K of those are distributed in roughly 2-4 years span). That relationship was destroyed by Kruks' invasion and the trading with Miah is interrupted - there might still be some new ones from Kruks but of different nature (and Kruks only sell complete packages rather than components for war purpose to some government). When Miah is gone, no one sells those system components any more, and early Miah-tech robots and components are antiques and very sought after and rare and expensive. The establishment of NFC (if it establish itself as the &quot;<em>Machine City</em>&quot; and promise a permissible place for all kinds) attracted much of remaining Miah and Kruks (those that are not hunt down) on earth, so there was once again circulation of highly intelligent (certain non-rule-based) intelligent systems (near human intelligence, depending on level of complexity) under and above the ground.</p>
<p>Besides the still scarce supply of highly intelligent general-AI systems, the push by Charles, Mr. Leng, and Delin Consultant in domains of architecture and construction have allowed much more mature development of specialized task-grade AI agents that can perform human-level tasks (without being able to thinkk that much or being sentien). For the general public, Hermis represents the highest level of general AI they can access, and even so it's just more of an amusement than anything more significant or practical (Hermis is generally available on mobile apps and museums). For more general purpose civilian use though, e.g. for <em>tour guide FAQ booths</em> - those use a different system, <em>more like a search engine</em> actually, called the <strong>IA Architecture</strong>, also invented by Charles <!--(Remark) As envisioned in Deep Dive.-->. Themis, on the other hand, is no longer a simple Eris Core-based derivation - through a few major upgrades, its architecture is now in the 4th generation <!--(Remark) Pending potential implementation schemes for this.--> and it's now a very secretive powerhouse of many things behind the CofN OP, governing many aspects of the city - it has full personal identity, and is a direct secretary to Leng House (and NOT accessible by Charles). The Demis is developed and maintained by <strong>War School of Whisper</strong> and <strong>The State Department for Advanced Defense</strong>, bringing all kinds of new research in weapon manuvour and related task-specific military related stuff.</p>

<li>(Idea, Film, Culture) It would be fun to have in the films and TV productions of CofN to always show those people or shops that are there for no reason - not because they are famous or what, but just randomly decided to form as a culture, e.g. a coffe shop, a particular well-recognized people (e.g. guards of a well-known building) that fictional characters in TV and films just like to visit.

<li>(Game, Sport) Robot Arena - large battle, high-end. See Battle Angel Alita. Highly consumable. The cost of a single robot can be up to about $40 billion, 100 times that of an F1 car. You can imagine how large such events must be - maybe an entire floor of NFC is devoted to that. (Event, Sport, City, Design, Element) Maybe the entire L6 is devoted to the battle arena of robots, a super high-end research-intense sport. Notice that would make sense because humans are in space age now due to the emergent pressure from alien species and imported technologies - and the space industry is a multi-trillion dollar industry with leading countries as North America and China (Union of some Asian countries) for mining and exterretial explorations. As such, those combat robots are merely side products from much larger and much heavier industry use robots sent to outer space. ¶There are three main competition types: Piloted, Remote Controlled, Automatic. Each with additional specific ranges of limits on component types and weights and size. Apparently some famous teams (single or co-op), companies and robot models are stars and heavily advertised.</li>

<h2 id="tourism">Tourism</h2>
<p>NFC is known for its hyper-realistic RPG/survival game industry, achieved with a mixture of The Many Worlds sim and specialized VR/AR playing devices, because of the insane amount of money pouring into world building and gaming in this city. Notice those are not typical video games, those are shaped towards creating hyper-realistic virtual world gaming experiences with specialized hardwares. In fact, NFC has such specialty that all typical video games or otherwise table top games (e.g. Hero Cards) have specialized gadgets to make them much more immersively interactive.</p>
<h2 id="city-features">City Features</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The city has flowers everywhere, everyone is very friendly, transportation is super convinient, food is very cheap and fresh. It's so comfortable to life and work here!&quot;
&quot;I would imagine for a large city like this it would be super crowded, but despite having a large population and limited space, everything is so well ordered. Even delicate!&quot;
&quot;One thing I like the most is the city is 'connected'! It's so easy to find what you want, either on your mobile phone or if you simply ask on the street - people will always have time and be very patient in helping you. Even if no one is around, you can always find assistant robots that can answer most of your questions.&quot;</p>

<li>(Infrastructure, City, Element) Info Booth: CofN library operated small information booth with AI Robot and some magazines to read. It's an search engine and also something for people to interact with in general.
<ul>
<li>(Design Factor) Derived principal: Interactive City - the city is &quot;playable&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Topic, Theme) (Redream, Dream Inspired, NFC, issie, Problem to Avoid, What-Not, 20220302) (Geographical Navigation and Sign Design) Per 20220302 Dream - Like, assuming someone doesn't have a phone and he's walking anywhere in Downtown - he should be able to very easily find out the best 煎饼店 in town, all locations with any business value should be judged and reviewed by an impartial judge and assessed its locationing system). That's the expectation of a modern city.
<ul>
<li>One technology based approach would be like modern NanJing shopping malls with those electronic (both display and control) road signs that can move and change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Topic, #Development) Ideal City: 1) Fresh vegetables and eggs and milk delivered to your door every morning/week, by robots! (Remark, #20230408) Instead of as Civic service we might consider making this as market driven and commercial service. In which case don't put it here under NFC but create a company for it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="transportations">Transportations</h3>
<ul>
<li>(Transportation, City, architecture) All roads have separate function for vehicles and pedestrians - this have at least 2 forms of implementation: 1) Ground floor is Garden-style 步行街 and vehicles run on the B1, 2) Vehicles run on the ground floor as is, but buildings are connected on the second or higher (but at least one per bottom 5 floors) floors so pedestrians walk on those.</li>
<li>(Transportation, Road) Fountain Crossing: A fountain crossing has roundabout like structure in the middle and each direction is blocked in the  road so one can only turn right. ¶Bridge Crossing: Not really a crossing since roads are blocked along a single path. ¶Some kind of road just for left turn? ¶There will not be any single-lane because that's lame and disgusting. (Remark) Notice those designs may NOT work - local traffic is destined to NOT travel very fast, even without pedestrians - as long as there is any need for crossings, including changing lanes and road-side parking (which requires merging) - in those cases it's better to let them move slowly. What's more, the feasibility of local-highway affects sound noise levels. One idea is to have only ever a three-laner: single direction path that leads to anywhere in the city.</li>
<li>Airship: With abundant He gas, Airship is the clean, noiseless and environmentally friendly way in a speedy, relaxy, suitable fashion for transporting goods and touring. It's flight height is limited to floor 1 and floor 2 for obvious reasions. Notice its noise can still be large and heard within 5km range. The usual landing site for recharging and maintainence everything is on the sea.</li>
<li>Jumps: The higher the angle (the more vertical) it is, the harder it is to construct (due to harder on vertical scale) - less that 45 degress can use ground bridge support, otherwise for higher than 75 degrees it can not easily be higher than 100 meters which means acceleration will be huge. The ideal situation is when the vessel (imagined as a spherical ball) arrives on the next level its vertical speed is zero, and all we need to do is to deaccelerate and cancel its horizontal speed - this determines length of arrival runway. We might be thinking about recycling jump vessels to use in drops, but their specs might be very different to make this not feasible. So the best way to transport jump vessels back might be through sky pillar. Hopefully it's cheap to produce those so we have plenty to use while others are being transported back.</li>
<li>Drop: The tube is filled with at least atmospheric gas, so there will be enough air friction to allow the vessel (imagined as a cylinder) to stop acceleartion at some constant drop speed - then when it's closer to the bottom it will stretch out a bit and the bottom air will be compressed, which causes it to deaccelerate. Lots of steams and water will be released at the bottom to help dissipate the heat due to compression of air. Ideally when it arrives on the bottom its speed is almost zero. The bottom can be an artificial wind tunnel which will blow wind when necessary to help deacceleration. The side of the tube determines the size of the vessel, which in term determines the capacity of passengers in each drop. We need to determine structural strength of the tube first to get its estimated diameter. The most cost effective way for tubes to go back to upper levels is through transport inside the sky pillars - so drops should usually be close to sky pillars.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ingredients-delivery-robots">Ingredients Delivery Robots</h4>
<p>Three key elements: 1) Dedicated lanes, either on pedestrian road or below it; 2) Dedicated right-of-way including at street crossing, and thus high grade street arrangement accuracy or robotic error tolerance; 3) Open-access delivery fridge and other containers, especially for houses.</p>
<p>This idea is like the general purpose delivery robots but with a special focus on ingredients, ideal for those who cook; This is not to take away the fun of picking  their own ingredients but as a convinience offer if someone wish to have ingredients ready at doorstep (even at the fridge) when they get home after work.</p>
<p>Additional ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>For condos and apartments they can instead have a concierge level shared delivery room.</li>
<li>The robots will mostly just stick to their way, and have minimal obstable walk-around capabilities for smaller obstablces (&lt;2m in dimension and &lt;1m in height).</li>
<li>Modern neighbourhoods get this more.</li>
<li>The delivery robots can be used by all shops, all shop owners, and all depositable residences, but with a focus on ingredients for those who self-cook and order online.</li>
<li>The entire <em>Urban Hermit (or &quot;Urban Loner&quot;) neighbourhood</em> (by architect Tao Ye) have those open-access fridges and storage boxes integrated with architecture design.</li>
<li>The delivery robots will use, and for standardization purpose, boxes as containers, since they are easier to manage and easier to put in containers.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="robotic-citizens">Robotic Citizens</h3>
<p>Full-sized (or higher sized) humanoid robotic bodies are allowed (and only those - not any other weird shapes) for Kruks mind-body-coexistence. Those are legalized to work and have a large suite of lawful legislations on them. For instance their <strong>shells</strong> can not be weaponized. And they can only move around in certain areas of certain floors. Usually they are not suitable for service-type work and most do labour-intensive work. Very rarely you can see smaller form-factor robotic humanoid robots walking on a CBD street - those robots typically have very high status, either earned by themselves or &quot;guaranteed&quot; by others (usually humans) - e.g. they are married to a human/they married a human.</p>
<p>Please do treat them like ordinary humans - and the basic courtesy is do not stare at them for a long time. They can get angry just like any other humans.</p>
<p>There are two dominant altitudes towards Kruks: 1) Humans are afraid of them because of WWIII; 2) Miahs hate them because of difference in value and their ongoing conflicts.</p>
