<p>Vandentra is an ancient city located in ??? (PENDING).
It's the first most active location during Tellurian-Medalian cultural exchange, and home to many of the latter-day NFC people e.g. Mr. Leng, where NFC was established on the ruins of Higasashi (Vancouver).</p>

<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<p>&quot;Toronto&quot; is derived from an Iroquois term meaning 'where there are trees in water' in reference to a weir for catching fish. We will use some kind of (made-up) native language with a similar meaning, in this case, &quot;vandens&quot; (water in Lithuanian) + &quot;tra&quot; (from &quot;tree&quot;) for &quot;water-ed trees&quot;, aka. &quot;Vandentra&quot;.</p>

<p>(PENDING INCORPORATION &quot;MAGICAL TELLURIAN WORLD&quot; E.G. LOT SOF TALL TREES IMAGES INTO THIS CITY AS WELL)</p>
<p>Vandentra is known for its iconic rock-cut architecture and its historical significance as the (ancient) capital city of the (Nabataeans). It is also famously referred to as the &quot;Rose City&quot; due to the pinkish hue of its sandstone cliffs. (We will consider putting this to the 外郊 of the city instead of the main area; The city Vandentra should be rather rich and abundant with greenaries and water so it can be a big modern city)</p>
