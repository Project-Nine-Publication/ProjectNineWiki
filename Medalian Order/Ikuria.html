<p>Ikuria people ARE a more suprior species. They are also among the first explorers and by far the best and furtherest explorers of our universe. For those reasons,  they naturally consider themselves above everyone else - even Medala and the original Kainians. They are also ruthless and can be violent and cold-blooded towards &quot;lower life forms&quot; - examples being the harvest for strange matters and human trafficking of earthlings. They even once dreamt of conquering Medala and invaded Doma System (with both a rebellion inside and forces from the outside) some 7000 years ago. They were very powerful (and Krurks naturally don't participate in this war nor help anyone) and almost reached Kai, when the true form of Queen showed up and defeated them once and for all and controlled them afterwards.</p>
