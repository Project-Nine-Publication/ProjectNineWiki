<!--Originally this was a social game; Later we conceptualize this as an AR exploration game (that game can be renamed as Parallel/Pocket Universe 平行/口袋时空 the treasure reward game).

Per the name though, maybe we can make it cooler: it's a mobile action game that lets player control a spaceship and navigate through gravity.-->
<p>Notice the idea/implemnetation/fantasy of such augmented reality or GIS games are indeed a charm! Because if you think about the real world here on Earth - our technology is so rudimentary there is no way to implement such a game, both because of the limit of GIS positioning accuracy, and hackable protocols because of mobile phones and lack of dedicated devices, and lack of processing powers and gigantic MMORPG database infrastructure and data link speed to support such game play. In other worlds, the real world city people ARE LIMITED TO PLAYING GAMES AT HOME, but simply don't have the interface or technology to play games like such in an augmented overlaid reality. As such, the game is a fantasy, and it's cool.</p>
