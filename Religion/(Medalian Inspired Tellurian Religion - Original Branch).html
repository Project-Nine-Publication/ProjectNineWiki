        <p>(This describes an &quot;original&quot; church or core divine idea that will spawn many branches of derived schools of thoughts that may or may not be identified as the same church; Originally there might be a few interpretations but eventually or one or two of such interpretaions/schools will gain popularity and the rest will just gradually fade out of historical stage; Notice the time period of actual Medalian staying in contact with Tellurians on a large international scale is short, maybe at most one decade)</p>
<p>Upon Medalian arrival and throughout the cultural change (originally as simple goods and trades change), people mutually learn language and Tellurians gain knowledge of Medalian language and science and culture. An idea with unkown source is circulated as &quot;Learning our language (or our systems of understanding or knowledge or science in general) will gie you the ability to understand and see future&quot;, which inspires people to learn more about this species (identied as &quot;Medalian学习热潮&quot; among 民科 or general public). This lacks virtues and requires hardship for real advancement so likely won't directly lead to a religon because it also lacks a savior aspect - in that case it's at least suitable for developing into cults, e.g. some leader might use this as a commercial chance to lure people into &quot;living the medalian ways&quot;, aka. to think, behave, and maybe escape as a Medalian and come to Medalian worlds. Especially since there is known to be a portal at the Sun - people might actually ACTIVELY want to go there, throwing millions not for travelling but changing a life, and human trafficking is not just an underground crime but a legit business with adults willingly to leave Tellus after all. On the other hand, (as another cult style movement) practioners might believe that Medalian knowledge and language can teach them future and get closer to becoming god, and treat learning the medalian way as a way to becoming God-like (to support this, we need to show enough miracles done by Medalians to make them believe those are NOT just aliens but Gods capable of doing inhuman things, especially when compared to historical knowledge of Gods which were Fepulans players). On the other hand, talking about Fepulans players, some may correlate the arrival of Medalians as another instance of &quot;god show humans and lead advancements of civilizations&quot; and think they ARE the ancient Gods the used to visit Tellus - which is wrong.
(idea from) Arrival 16 is not a movie, but an art.</p>
