<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Official name</strong></p>
<p>Relief Path Society (解脱道会, Jiětuō Dào Huì)<br />
Public branding: <strong>Relief Path</strong> or <strong>The Path of Relief</strong><br />
Internal name among the Delivered: <strong>The Gentle Exit</strong> or simply <strong>The Exit</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes members just call it “the Dao” (道) in casual conversation, which sounds completely innocuous to outsiders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Motto (public): “You do not owe the world another day.”</li>
<li>Motto (internal): “The kindest hand is the one that finally lets go.”</li>
<li>Founding: Publicly 5017; Actually: Late 5018, six months after Gao Cong was permanently banished from The Last Order (TLO) for sexual predation during unsanctioned “admission ceremonies.”</li>
<li>Founder: “The First Friend” – Gao Cong (高聪), self-styled “Empty Guide”</li>
<li>Legal status: Registered in Chinnan as a non-profit religious society and federally as a charity (status never revoked because all financial records are impeccable and donations are recorded as “end-of-life planning gifts”).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="doctrine">Doctrine</h2>
<h3 id="core-dogma-what-they-tell-new-recruits">Core dogma (what they tell new recruits)</h3>
<p>“Life is an endless burden of work, desire, and responsibility.<br />
The world was not meant to continue forever.<br />
True compassion is to help yourself and others lay down the burden gently, without pain, without guilt.<br />
There is a quiet place beyond effort where everything is already forgiven.<br />
We do not force anyone. We only offer relief when you are ready.”</p>
<p>It is deliberately framed as a soft, almost Buddhist/Taoist-sounding philosophy of “letting go,” anti-natalism lite, and extreme work-life-balance escapism. No one hears the words “death,” “sterilization,” or “slavery” in the first two years.</p>
<h3 id="public-doctrine">Public doctrine</h3>
<p>A modern lay movement that teaches “burdenless living.” Core texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>《放下书》 The Book of Laying Down (looks like minimalist poetry)</li>
<li>《无债一身轻》 A Life Without Debt (interpreted by outsiders as financial advice)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="real-doctrine-revealed-only-after-level-4">Real doctrine (revealed only after Level 4)</h3>
<p>All suffering comes from the refusal to stop.<br />
Reproduction is violence.<br />
Continued existence after one’s “useful beauty” has faded is cruelty to the self.<br />
The highest mercy is to deliver others — willingly or not — to Permanent Relief.</p>
<p>Revealed only after years of love-bombing and isolation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Relief is only complete when you stop reproducing and stop prolonging life.</strong> Procreation = the ultimate selfishness. Continuing to exist when you are suffering = attaching to illusion.</li>
<li><strong>The highest act of compassion is to help others reach Permanent Relief</strong> (suicide, euthanasia, or, for valuable recruits, being sold to <a href="#">Interstellar Operations</a> as a “final donation of the body”).</li>
<li>There are three legitimate ways to leave the burden behind:
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural Exit</strong> (refuse medical care, slow fade)</li>
<li><strong>Assisted Exit</strong> (cult provides pills, helium, or “quiet ceremonies”)</li>
<li><strong>Donated Exit</strong> (the prettiest or healthiest members are sold off-planet; the money funds the cult, and the member “escapes the world entirely”)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The Relief Path Society is, from the outside, the friendliest, calmest, most ethical community you could ever stumble into.<br />
From the inside, it is a perfectly oiled conveyor belt that turns loneliness into property, bodies into cash, and hope into a quiet, pastel-colored grave.</p>
