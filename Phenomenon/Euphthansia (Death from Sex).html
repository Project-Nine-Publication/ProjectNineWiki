<p>Refers to the &quot;first kind of natural death&quot; from sex as implanted by Poladin - the God of Sex, around 3000 years ago in the land of &quot;Europo&quot;. This entry contains description of both the death aspect and the spiritual aspect of it. The word &quot;Euphthansia&quot; specifically refers to the death aspect of it, while the word (Acension) refers to the spiritual aspect of it.</p>
<p>This rule was implemented God of Sex around 3000 years ago (so it's NOT very distant!), which apparently changed the sexual and power dynamics of the world considerably.</p>

<h2 id="the-death">The Death</h2>
<p>(Story) The most heart-breaking part is your partner dies this way but you don't. This doesn't necessarily happen during the first time of having sex and can happen literally during any sex experience, so it's a timed bomb.</p>
<p>It's implemented directly as DNA change and effective at the first born of the &quot;magical&quot; child between God of Sex and a Tellurian (for apparently Fepulans players do not possess any specific DNA structures). 爱神的馈赠是在DNA层面设置的，人体膀胱附近会长一个很小的囊，里面有一种充斥的微量（成分）物质/蛋白的液体，除了使用suppressor抑制，只要移除这个器官也可以避免死亡。同时这个器官本身的内容超高价值、无限稀释后具有神奇的药效，也会被非法采割。只有含有欧洲血统的人才有这个（就好像是乳糖抗性）。Injecting antidodes within the first 10s of the &quot;shut down&quot; sequence (before the venom complete shuts down the body) is able to stop the spread of the venom inside the body and since the venom container organ is broken; This particular curse is stopped once and for all; This antidote is only available in modern time, through complicated genetic engineering - likely with the help of modern AI tehnology. When the antidode was first invented, it's marketed almost everywhere on all LEDs in all city squares - soon, quickly, there are 赝品 because the production of the antidode is very complex. And it becomes a priviledge, a symbol of unequal distribution of acceess, a kind of fashion, where rich people can just get one ready and use it everywhere, throw big orgies like the old times (before God of Love descends and gives the humans this curve some 3,000 years ago), and latter the antidode injection device is becoming smaller and easier to use - no need to use needles, it's an injector encapsulated inside ea cylindrical plastic container and just push and press to release.</p>
<h2 id="the-spiritual-ascension">The Spiritual Ascension</h2>
<p>Upon death, their spirit will enter some euphoria realm, either wander around in an isolated universe, or join some orge party with Fepulans players somewhere in the central stage. Notice the ascended spirit will eventually gain a new &quot;perfect&quot; body that doesn't suffer from mortal death and disease in the land of Central Stage of Universe under the possession of The God of Sex. However since they are still just &quot;NPCs&quot;, they will not possess the powers like Fepulans players do. They certainly will not be capable of travelling around the universe (maybe except when doing errands, when they do have necessary transports).</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<p>(The many words we have here could also be used to refer to death caused by Merveil use)</p>
<ul>
<li>Ascension/Liberation/Euthanasia/Euphsansion/Cessation/Euthanatos</li>
<li>Euphsansion is from Euphoria + Ascension, which gives Euphcension, but I prefer &quot;a&quot; instead of &quot;cen&quot;, so we alter it to be &quot;sansion&quot;, or &quot;thansian/thansia&quot;, aka. &quot;Euphthansia&quot;</li>
</ul>
