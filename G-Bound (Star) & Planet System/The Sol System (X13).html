        <p>Tellurian solar system containing two stars.</p>
<p>The Sol system (now called X13 to avoid confusion with the Solar System) is the planet system centered around binary stars (suns) named Sol I and Sol II (will be renamed in the future), abbreviated as Sol-II, in the galaxy of Exvatum. The Sol system is where the Tellurians live. It's labelled as &quot;X13&quot; in the Medalian catelog. Five out of the nine full-sized planets contain lives in Sol-II, though some are very preliminary. Among those, notably the planet Audas has large populations of local &quot;monkey-like&quot; communities that spans great areas of the planet. Sol System is in CSU. In the order of proximity to planet system barycenter, those are the planets: Mesepoto, Centas, Dahoa (another name for Tellus), Trilaris, Audas, Kolen, Manulos, Nestro, Chaoni.</p>
<p>(PENDING FIGURING OUT EXACT ORBITING CONFIGURATION WITH A SIMULATION)
(PENDING FULL ILLUSTRATION OF NOT-TO-SCALE VISUALIZATION OF ALL LARGER SCALE ASTRONOMIAL AND ARTIFICIAL OBJECTS IN SOL-II IN A SPHERICAL 3D VISUALIZATION)
(PENDING STUDYING POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF HAVING TWO SUNS ON CLIMATE/SEASON/DAYNIGHT CYCLE/GRAVITY AND LIFESTYLE ON TELLUS)</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-etymology">Naming and Etymology</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Sol System: Because Sun is called Sol.</li>
<li>Sol-II system: Because it has two stars.</li>
<li>X13: Canonical Minicore proposed name.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, notice since now we put Earth and Sun and The Milky Way and Andromeda as proper in-world entities, this name must change to avoid confusion. For now, X13 is better than &quot;Sol-II&quot; for it's more specific.</p>
<h2 id="the-sol-ii-system">The Sol-II System</h2>
<p>The Sol-II system contains two suns, 9 full-sized planets, along with a dozen moons and dwarf planets, and the usual astroid regions.</p>
<p>Below are the major astronomical bodies for the Sol System.</p>
<h3 id="suns">Suns</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sol I: Sun of the system; In reference to our Sun.</li>
<li>Sol II: Sun of the system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="full-sized-planets">Full-Sized Planets</h3>
<p>(What's the etymology/origin of those names? Put them into individual Wiki items or Tellurian etymology vocabulary notes)</p>
<ul>
<li>Tellus (Has Life): The single inhabitable planet in the Sol system with intelligent/ciilized lives; It has a single moon named Lula. In reference to our Earth.</li>
<li>Nestro: Gas giant.</li>
<li>Kolen (Has Life): Another planet.</li>
<li>Trilaris: Another planet.</li>
<li>Chaoni: Gas giant in the outer part of Sol system.</li>
<li>Audas (Has Life): In reference to Mars.</li>
<li>Manulos (Has Life)</li>
<li>Centas (Has Life)</li>
<li>Mesepoto</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dwarf-planets">Dwarf Planets</h3>
<p>(PENDING)</p>
<p>Dwarf planets that have lands are magical places that might have magical dwellings/resources.</p>
<h3 id="moons">Moons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lula: Moon of Tellus.</li>
<li>Yagini (unassigned)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="named-astroids">Named Astroids</h3>
<p>(PENDING)</p>
<p>Some are said to be hermitage of ancient gods (do those gods live in caves? Why not choose a planet😂).</p>
<h3 id="special-geo-spatial-regions">Special Geo-spatial Regions</h3>
<p>(PENDING)</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(#20230622) Now that we are committed to the possibility of this system to have two stars, that will necessarily cause some drama to the geology and development of the rest of the solar system. However, we do not need full scale simulation - as long as we can somehow come up with a configuration that works, we are good.</li>
</ul>
